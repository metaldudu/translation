不！不，不！
NO! NO, NO!

22
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,206
九，九……
NINE, NINE...

23
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,375
（电话铃声响起）
( phone rings )

24
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,377
男：紧急情况。哪种服务？
Man: EMERGENCY. WHICH SERVICE?

25
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,511
警察！
POLICE!

26
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,513
我要报警！
GET ME THE POLICE!

27
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,382
（雷声轰鸣）
( thunder crashes )

28
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,456
威尔弗雷德爵士：别那么快，你们这些笨蛋。
Sir Wilfred: NOT SO FAST, YOU NINCOMPOOPS.

29
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,125
车在哪里？
WHERE'S THE CAR?

30
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,433
你在目瞪口呆什么？
WHAT ARE YOU GAPING AT?

31
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,001
我要感谢你们
I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU

32
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,405
感谢你们的关心和照顾。
FOR ALL YOUR CARE AND KINDNESS.

33
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,141
我这一生，
THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE,

34
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,842
我从来没有...
I'VE NEVER...

35
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,544
这么痛苦过。
BEEN SO MISERABLE.

36
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,914
好的，祝您一切顺利。
WELL, I WISH YOU ALL GOOD DAY.

37
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,117
永远顺利。
I HOPE FOREVER.

38
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,186
来吧，来吧。是什么让我们坚持下去的？
COME ALONG, COME ALONG. WHAT'S KEEPING US?

39
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,855
我不知道他今天出院了。
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS BEING DISCHARGED TODAY.

40
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,024
出院？他是被赶走的。
DISCHARGED? HE'S BEEN EXPELLED.

41
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,826
护士： 老狐狸终于走了。
Nurse: THERE GOES THE OLD FOX AT LAST.

42
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,161
多么美丽的景象啊。
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

43
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,163
再见，威尔弗雷德爵士！再见，威尔弗雷德爵士！
GOOD-BYE, SIR WILFRED! BYE, SIR WILFRED!

44
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,099
护士们：再见！再见！
Nurses: BYE! BYE!

45
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,507
你觉得他还会来吗？
YOU THINK HE'LL BE BACK AGAIN?

46
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,077
如果他再来，我就辞职。
IF HE DOES, I'M LEAVING.

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,616
普利姆索尔小姐：噢，天哪，真是悲惨的一天。
Miss Plimsoll: OH, MY, WHAT A MISERABLE DAY.

48
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:20,052
非常适合您回家。
JUST PERFECT FOR YOUR HOMECOMING.

49
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,054
你知道，我总是说
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY

50
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,255
下雨是值得的
IT'S WORTH HAVING THE RAIN

51
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,391
算是为了珍惜阳光——
JUST TO APPRECIATE THE SUNSHINE--

52
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,926
说起来。
WHEN IT COMES.

53
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,928
哦，告诉我，是不是风有点大？
OH, TELL ME, IS THERE TOO MUCH DRAFT?

54
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,129
我要关上窗户吗？
SHALL I SHUT THE WINDOW?

55
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,099
不，闭嘴，好吗？
NO, JUST SHUT UP, WILL YOU?

56
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,167
唉，你又调皮了
NOW, YOU'RE BEING NAUGHTY AGAIN,

57
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,202
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

58
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,537
我们必须精神起来。
WE MUST KEEP OUR SPIRITS UP.

59
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,985
我就是喜欢伦敦。
I JUST ADORE LONDON.

60
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,820
这太古怪了。
IT'S SO ECCENTRIC.

61
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,390
威尔弗雷德爵士，您是在皇宫被封为爵士的吗？
WERE YOU KNIGHTED AT THE PALACE, SIR WILFRED?

62
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:01,060
不，我想是在动物园。
NO, AT THE ZOO, I THINK.

63
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,196
看，哈罗德百货公司。
LOOK, THERE'S HARRODS.

64
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,931
我所有的袜子都是在那里买的。
I BUY ALL MY STOCKINGS THERE.

65
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,167
是吗。
AMAZING.

66
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,047
你知道，
YOU KNOW,

67
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,150
多年之前我差点就和一个法学院学生结婚了
I ALMOST MARRIED A LAW STUDENT YEARS AGO,

68
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,818
但他感染了肺炎死了，
BUT HE CAUGHT PNEUMONIA AND WENT,

69
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,119
就像那样。
JUST LIKE THAT.

70
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,387
他给吓死了，是不是？
DIED OF FRIGHT, DIDN'T HE?

71
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,259
小心点，威尔弗雷德爵士。
CAREFUL, NOW, SIR WILFRED.

72
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,295
记住，你已经平躺了
REMEMBER, YOU'VE BEEN FLAT ON YOUR BACK, NOW,

73
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,296
两个月。
FOR TWO MONTHS.

74
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,463
哦，退后，退后。
OH, STAND BACK, STAND BACK.

75
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,532
威廉姆斯，我的手杖。
WILLIAMS, MY CANE.

76
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:26,078
他来了！
HERE HE COMES!

77
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,449
我，我。
ME, ME.

78
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,926
早上好。
GOOD MORNING.

79
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,194
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

80
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,498
（电话响起）谢谢。
( telephone rings ) THANK YOU.

81
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:49,935
大家回去工作吧。
EVERYONE, BACK TO WORK.

82
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,204
（哭泣）
( weeping )

83
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,907
你怎么了？
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

84
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,141
好吧，您心脏病发作后——
WELL, I-- I WAS AFRAID

85
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,576
我一直很害怕
AFTER YOUR HEART ATTACK THAT--

86
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,847
但您又来了，完好如初了！
BUT HERE YOU ARE, YOUR OLD SELF AGAIN!

87
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,316
再这样多愁善感，
ANY MORE OF SUCH SENTIMENTALITY,

88
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,986
我就直接回医院去。
AND I GO STRAIGHT BACK TO HOSPITAL.

89
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,154
不可能。回去他们也不收你。
NOT LIKELY. THEY WON'T TAKE YOU BACK.

90
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,558
普利姆索尔，把它们放进水里。
PLIMSOLL, PUT THOSE IN WATER.

91
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,160
来吧，卡特。
COME ALONG, CARTER.

92
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,903
看看这个房间。
LOOK AT THIS ROOM.

93
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,505
苍老的。丑陋的。
OLD. UGLY.

94
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,574
发霉 的。
MUSTY.

95
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,912
我一直都不知道
I NEVER KNEW

96
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,581
我会错过这么多事情。
I COULD MISS ANYTHING SO MUCH.

97
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,552
我也想念你，卡特。
MISSED YOU TOO, CARTER.

98
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,088
发霉的老秃鹰。
MUSTY OLD BUZZARD.

99
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,890
谢谢您，先生。
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.

100
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,159
先生，我不是一个信徒，
I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON, SIR,

101
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,095
但当他们用救护车把您带走时
BUT WHEN THEY TOOK YOU AWAY IN THAT AMBULANCE,

102
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,231
我点了一根蜡烛。
I LIT A CANDLE.

103
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,034
哦，谢谢你，卡特。
OH, THANK YOU, CARTER.

104
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,069
哦，实际上我点蜡烛
OH, ACTUALLY I WAS LIGHTING IT

105
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,971
是为了我自己，先生。
FOR MYSELF, SIR.

106
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,140
我的意思是，这些年过去了，
I MEAN, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO YOU,

107
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:04,576
如果您出了什么事，我会怎么样？
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

108
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,945
哦，确实如此。
OH, INDEED.

109
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:08,213
我从您审判第一个......
I STARTED WITH YOUR FIRST...

110
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,382
谋杀案就跟着您，你知道。
MURDER TRIAL, YOU KNOW.

111
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,885
确实，你做到了。
INDEED, YOU DID.

112
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,020
三十七年前。
THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO.

113
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,622
我还戴着同样的假发。
I'VE STILL GOT THE SAME WIG.

114
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,658
面对现实吧，卡特，你愿意吗？
FACE IT, CARTER, WILL YOU?

115
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,127
是的，先生，我是……
YES, SIR, I'M...

116
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,964
恐怕我们已经把它收起来了，先生。
I'M AFRAID WE PUT IT AWAY, SIR.

117
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,098
收起来？
PUT IT AWAY?

118
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,867
在樟脑丸里。
IN MOTH BALLS.

119
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,502
樟脑丸。
MOTH BALLS.

120
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,905
我看你以为我不会再上庭了。
I SUPPOSE YOU THOUGHT I WASN'T GOING TO PRACTICE AGAIN.

121
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,406
哦，不，先生，
OH, NO, SIR,

122
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,175
我们有几个有趣的案子等着您
WE HAVE SEVERAL INTERESTING BRIEFS FOR YOU.

123
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,077
离婚案、税务上诉、
A DIVORCE CASE, TAX APPEAL,

124
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,678
非常简单——费用优厚。
VERY SIMPLE-- EXCELLENT FEES.

125
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,347
那不可能。
NEVER THAT.

126
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,881
对不起，威尔弗雷德爵士，
I'M SORRY, SIR WILFRED,

127
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,016
但您不应该承担
BUT YOU'RE NOT TO UNDERTAKE

128
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,484
更多的刑事案件了。
ANY MORE CRIMINAL CASES.

129
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,618
医生 -
THE DOCTORS--

130
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,020
医生？
DOCTORS?

131
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,589
他们剥夺了我的一切——
THEY'VE DEPRIVED ME OF EVERYTHING--

132
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,492
烟草、酒精、
TOBACCO, ALCOHOL,

133
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,628
女性伴侣。
FEMALE COMPANIONS.

134
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,030
卡特。
CARTER.

135
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,331
是的先生？
YES, SIR?

136
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,900
给我一个更大的盒子，
BRING ME A BIGGER BOX,

137
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,369
更大的樟脑丸。
BIGGER MOTH BALLS.

138
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,142
把我也放进去。
AND PUT ME AWAY IN IT, TOO.

139
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,047
11:30，威尔弗雷德爵士。
11:30, SIR WILFRED.

140
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,350
午餐前小睡一下。
TIME FOR A NAP BEFORE LUNCH.

141
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,651
晚点再说吧。
LATER.

142
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:22,921
来吧，现在送你上楼吧。
COME, NOW, LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS.

143
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,556
让我们帮你脱衣服
LET'S GET YOU UNDRESSED

144
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,291
我们会躺下。
AND WE'LL LIE DOWN.

145
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,293
我们？
WE?

146
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,430
真是前途美好啊。
WHAT A PROSPECT.

147
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,266
楼上，快来吧。
UPSTAIRS, COME ALONG NOW.

148
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,868
哦，别——别拉我。
OH, DON'T-- DON'T PULL ME.

149
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,069
我——我可要打人了。
I--I COULD STRIKE.

150
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,138
哦，你永远不会那样做。
OH, YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

151
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:40,406
你可能会弄坏你的雪茄。
YOU MIGHT BREAK YOUR CIGARS.

152
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,442
什么——什么雪茄？
WHAT-- WHAT CIGARS?

153
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,311
那些你偷偷藏起来的。
THE ONES YOU'VE BEEN SMUGGLING.

154
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,083
雪茄怎么会在这里？
HOW--HOW DID THEY GET THERE?

155
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,253
在医院里他偷着藏白兰地。
IN HOSPITAL HE'D HIDE THE BRANDY, TOO.

156
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,622
我们叫他“狐狸威尔弗雷德”。
WE CALLED HIM "WILFRED THE FOX."

157
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,660
这些我没收了。
I'M CONFISCATING THESE.

158
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,429
留一支……就一支？
JUST... JUST ONE?

159
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,865
不。请上楼。
NO. UPSTAIRS, PLEASE.

160
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,233
我的意思是，呃，
I MEAN, UH,

161
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,035
来一个泡芙？
J-JUST A PUFF?

162
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,770
午饭以后？
AFTER MEALS?

163
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,206
普利姆索尔小姐：不是之前，不是期间，也不是之后。
Miss Plimsoll: NOT BEFORE, NOT DURING, NOT AFTER.

164
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,908
威尔弗雷德爵士，雪茄是……
CIGARS, SIR WILFRED, ARE...

165
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:17,076
别惊讶，卡特。
DON'T BE SURPRISED, CARTER.

166
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,310
某个漆黑的夜晚，
SOME DARK NIGHT,

167
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,179
我要把她的温度计插入
I SHALL PLUNGE HER THERMOMETER

168
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,448
进入她的心里。
INTO HER HEART.

169
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,049
（打字机按键声）
( typewriter keys tapping )

170
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,084
哦，不，先生。
OH, NO, SIR.

171
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,351
您绝对不能走楼梯。
YOU MUSTN'T WALK UP.

172
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,719
我们现在有电梯了。
WE HAVE THE LIFT NOW.

173
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,121
那部电梯已经一年没用了。
THAT LIFT HASN'T WORKED FOR A YEAR.

174
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,355
确实，先生，这就是原因
INDEED, SIR, THAT'S WHY

175
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,191
为了您回来我们把它修好了。
WE HAD IT REPAIRED FOR YOUR RETURN.

176
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:33,225
医生对此很坚决。
THE DOCTOR WAS ADAMANT ABOUT IT.

177
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,493
他要求如此。
HE ORDERED IT.

178
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,961
你确定它——
ARE YOU SURE THAT IT'S--

179
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,262
哦，是的，现在非常可靠。
OH, YES, IT'S QUITE RELIABLE NOW.

180
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,164
我们走吧？
SHALL WE GO?

181
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,069
梅休：早上好，奥布莱恩小姐。
Mayhew: GOOD MORNING, MISS O'BRIEN.

182
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,404
啊！
AH!

183
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,305
梅休！
MAYHEW!

184
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,874
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

185
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,976
很高兴见到你
HOW VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU

186
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,578
再次回到工作岗位。
BACK ON THE JOB AGAIN.

187
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:53,679
没有什么安排
NOTHING SCHEDULED

188
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,247
除了一些乏味的民事案件。
EXCEPT A FEW DULL CIVIL CASES.

189
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,615
嗯，在这种情况下，我认为
WELL, IN THAT CASE, I THINK

190
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,484
我可能有一些有趣的东西给你。
I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING INTERESTING FOR YOU.

191
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,486
我的客户就在我身边
I HAVE MY CLIENT RIGHT HERE WITH ME

192
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,920
还有，呃...
AND, UH...

193
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,289
这是先生。伦纳德·沃尔。
THIS IS MR. LEONARD VOLE.

194
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,525
他的处境非常糟糕，
AND HE'S IN QUITE A GHASTLY MESS,

195
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,626
我恐怕。
I'M AFRAID.

196
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,394
哦？
OH?

197
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,997
你好吗，沃尔先生？
HOW DO YOU DO, MR. VOLE?

198
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,065
噢，就像梅休先生说的，
WELL, ACCORDING TO MR. MAYHEW,

199
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,166
不太好，先生。
NOT VERY WELL, SIR.

200
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,567
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

201
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,469
现在是 11 点 45 分。
IT'S 11:45.

202
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,405
我知道现在是什么时候了。
I KNOW WHAT THE TIME IS.

203
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,543
抱歉，明年，梅休。
SORRY, NEXT YEAR, MAYHEW.

204
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,380
很高兴——很高兴见到你，我的孩子。
NICE--NICE TO HAVE MET YOU, MY BOY.

205
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,916
很高兴，先生。
MY PLEASURE, SIR.

206
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,198
威尔弗雷德爵士：多么有趣啊。
Sir Wilfred: HOW INTERESTING.

207
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,468
我们到了。
HERE WE ARE.

208
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,703
来吧，来吧，威尔弗雷德爵士。
COME, COME ALONG, SIR WILFRED.

209
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,678
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

210
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,313
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

211
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,016
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

212
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,184
在康复期间，
WHILE HE'S CONVALESCING,

213
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,985
他真的不能接受任何
HE REALLY CAN'T ACCEPT ANY CASE

214
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,320
具有犯罪性质的案子。
OF A CRIMINAL NATURE.

215
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,488
医生要求所有人——
THE DOCTOR HAS REQUESTED ALL--

216
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,223
普利姆索尔小姐：威尔弗雷德爵士！
Miss Plimsoll: SIR WILFRED!

217
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,357
啊，先生们。
AH, GENTLEMEN.

218
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,559
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

219
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,960
现在，一切都好了，卡特。
NOW, IT'S ALL RIGHT, CARTER.

220
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,261
我们不接受案情摘要。
WE'RE NOT TAKING HIS BRIEF.

221
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,896
但梅休是一位老朋友，
BUT MAYHEW IS AN OLD FRIEND,

222
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,997
我确信他可以
AND I'M SURE HE COULD

223
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,332
听听一些建议。
DO WITH SOME ADVICE.

224
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,233
哦！是的。
OH! YES.

225
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,601
嗯，我——我——
WELL, I--I--

226
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,002
我可以给你五分钟，可以吗？
I COULD GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES, COULDN'T I?

227
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,771
好吧，您真是太好了，先生，但是——
WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, SIR, BUT--

228
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,806
普利姆索尔小姐：威尔弗雷德！啊，不，梅休。
Miss Plimsoll: WILFRED! AH, NO, MAYHEW.

229
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,542
请只有你和我。谢谢。
JUST YOU AND I, PLEASE. THANK YOU.

230
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,177
（叹气）
( sighs )

231
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,046
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

232
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,781
你的小睡！
YOUR NAP!

233
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,716
你先去吧，不用等我。
YOU GO AHEAD AND START IT WITHOUT ME.

234
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,818
（叹气）
( sighs )

235
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,387
这是你的错，先生。卡特。
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, MR. CARTER.

236
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,922
你怎么能这么说呢？
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

237
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,357
我告诉过你了——对不起。
I TOLD YOU-- EXCUSE ME.

238
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,725
呃，但如果这是任何人的错，
UH, BUT IF IT'S ANYONE'S FAULT,

239
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,693
这是我的。
IT'S MINE.

240
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,161
现在对我来说这似乎很愚蠢，
IT SEEMS SILLY TO ME NOW,

241
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,329
但是先生。梅休认为
BUT MR. MAYHEW THINKS

242
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:51,463
我可能会被捕
THAT I MIGHT BE ARRESTED

243
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,698
任何时候。
AT ANY MOMENT.

244
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,066
为了什么？
FOR WHAT?

245
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:55,968
恩...
WELL...

246
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,603
为了谋杀。
FOR MURDER.

247
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,345
这个，呃，女人，
THIS, UH, WOMAN,

248
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,080
一位中年寡妇，
A MIDDLE-AGED WIDOW,

249
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,414
和，嗯，在汉普斯特德
WAS LIVING WITH, UM,

250
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,382
和一名管家住在一起
A HOUSEKEEPER IN HAMPSTEAD.

251
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,150
管家声称
THE HOUSEKEEPER CLAIMS

252
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,885
沃尔先生拜访了寡妇
THAT MR. VOLE VISITED THE WIDOW

253
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,154
同一天晚上她被发现——
THE SAME EVENING SHE WAS FOUND DEAD--

254
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:17,923
后脑勺被打击致死。
STRUCK IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

255
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,224
我懂了。
I SEE.

256
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,226
他看起来是一个善良、无害的小伙子，
HE SEEMS SUCH A NICE, HARMLESS CHAP,

257
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,861
就是落在
SIMPLY CAUGHT

258
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,397
一堆证据当中。
IN A WEB OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

259
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,166
我想知道，您能帮忙
I WONDER, COULD YOU PERHAPS

260
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,936
考虑一下如何辩护吗？
THINK OF A LINE OF DEFENSE?

261
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,140
我认为最好搭配雪茄。
I THINK BEST WITH A CIGAR.

262
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,277
哦，哦，是的，先生。
OH, OH, YES, SIR.

263
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,312
是的当然。
YES, OF COURSE.

264
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,115
他是一个品格良好的人——
HE'S A MAN OF GOOD CHARACTER--

265
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,383
一个美国人，还有——
AN AMERICAN WITH A--

266
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:45,417
出色的参战记录。
AN EXCELLENT WAR RECORD.

267
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,286
我知道您会喜欢他的。
I KNOW YOU'LL LIKE HIM.

268
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:50,155
她没收了火柴。
SHE'S CONFISCATED THE MATCHES.

269
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,090
打火机？
A LIGHT?

270
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,060
哦没问题。对不起。
OH, SURE. I'M SORRY.

271
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,729
呃，我去给你拿。
UH, I'LL GET YOU ONE.

272
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,431
不，不——不，不，不，不。
NO, NO-- NO, NO, NO, NO.

273
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,367
你知道普利姆索尔小姐。
YOU DO KNOW MISS PLIMSOLL.

274
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,504
我们得学聪明点。
THIS WILL TAKE ALL OUR CUNNING.

275
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,280
年轻人。
YOUNG MAN.

276
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,015
说到一个重点。
A RATHER IMPORTANT POINT.

277
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,283
你可以过来
IF YOU COULD JUST JOIN US

278
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,351
和我们待一会儿吗？
FOR A MOMENT?

279
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
当然，先生。
OF COURSE, SIR.

280
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:22,387
谢谢。
THANK YOU.

281
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,362
先生？
SIR?

282
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,229
给我一根火柴。
GIVE ME A MATCH.

283
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,331
什么？
WHAT?

284
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:33,932
给我一根火柴。
GIVE ME A MATCH.

285
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,735
抱歉，我从来不带火柴。
I'M SORRY, I NEVER CARRY THEM.

286
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,070
我的天啊。
OH, MY GOD.

287
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:39,304
你说过我会喜欢他。
YOU SAID I'D LIKE HIM.

288
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,074
不过，我有一个打火机。
I DO HAVE A LIGHTER, HOWEVER.

289
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,148
这小伙子不错。
CHARMING FELLOW.

290
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,885
沃尔先生，不管你是否
MR. VOLE, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT

291
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,021
谋杀了一位中年寡妇，
HAVE MURDERED A MIDDLE-AGED WIDOW,

292
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,223
但你救了一位老律师的命。
BUT YOU'VE SAVED THE LIFE OF AN OLD BARRISTER.

293
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,491
嗯，这可太美妙了。
WELL, IT'S ALL SO FANTASTIC.

294
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,226
我没有谋杀任何人。
I HAVEN'T MURDERED ANYONE.

295
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,427
我的上帝！
MY GOD!

296
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,862
我讨厌任何形式的暴力。
I HATE VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND.

297
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,198
我来这里只是因为克里斯汀——
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE CHRISTINE--

298
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,566
我的妻子 -
THAT'S MY WIFE--

299
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,234
觉得我可能会受到某种程度的牵连。
THOUGHT I MIGHT BE IMPLICATED IN SOME WAY.

300
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,937
我真的需要两名律师吗？
DO I REALLY NEED TWO LAWYERS?

301
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,373
对不起，只是——这看起来很傻。
EXCUSE ME, JUST-- IT SEEMS SILLY.

302
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,874
沃尔先生。
MR. VOLE.

303
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,110
在这个国家，那些犯下谋杀罪的人
THOSE WHO COMMIT MURDER IN THIS COUNTRY

304
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,511
将会面对刽子手。
FACE THE HANGMAN.

305
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,246
这很傻吗？
IS THAT SILLY?

306
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,414
不，先生。
NO, SIR.

307
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,615
我--我--我--我不是这个意思--
I--I--I-- I DIDN'T MEAN--

308
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,083
梅休，你向他解释一下，
MAYHEW, YOU EXPLAIN TO HIM,

309
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,151
好吗？
WILL YOU?

310
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,753
我是一名律师，沃尔先生。
I AM A SOLICITOR, MR. VOLE.

311
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,454
威尔弗雷德爵士是一名大律师，
SIR WILFRED IS A BARRISTER,

312
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,722
而且只有大律师
AND ONLY A BARRISTER

313
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,324
可以在法庭上答辩。
CAN PLEAD A CASE IN COURT.

314
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,759
事实上
THE FACT IS

315
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,427
我给警察做了笔录。
I MADE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.

316
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,628
他们看起来很满意。
THEY SEEMED QUITE SATISFIED.

317
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,397
他们似乎很满意。
THEY SEEMED SATISFIED.

318
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,798
他做了笔录
HE MADE A STATEMENT

319
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,500
并认为这就是结束。
AND THINKS THAT'S THE END OF IT.

320
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,235
你是主要嫌疑人。
YOU ARE A PRINCIPAL SUSPECT.

321
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,770
为什么？为什么——为什么我因为
WHY? WHY--WHY SHOULD I BE ARRESTED

322
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,570
没做过的事情而被捕？
FOR SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE?

323
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,239
放松，沃尔先生。
RELAX, MR. VOLE.

324
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,473
现在你正在伦敦最优秀的大律师
YOU ARE NOW IN THE HANDS

325
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,208
的办公室里
OF THE FINEST BARRISTER IN LONDON.

326
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,810
梅休。
MAYHEW.

327
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,412
我可以接受你的雪茄，
I MAY HAVE TAKEN YOUR CIGAR,

328
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,981
但我不会受理你的案子。
BUT I'M NOT TAKING YOUR CASE.

329
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,315
坚持住，好吗？
HOLD THAT, WILL YOU?

330
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:01,286
案子提交给布罗根摩尔先生。
I SUBMIT WE CALL ON MR. BROGAN-MOORE.

331
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,320
一个非常能干的人。
A VERY ABLE MAN.

332
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,790
哦，卡特。
OH, CARTER.

333
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,792
叫布罗根摩尔先生一离开法庭
ASK MR. BROGAN-MOORE TO COME TO ME

334
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,260
就来找我
AS SOON AS HE LEAVES THE COURT.

335
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,561
是的先生。威尔弗雷德爵士。
YES, SIR. SIR WILFRED.

336
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,063
自从我在战争期间
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN SUCH INSUBORDINATION

337
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,366
做前线护士以来
SINCE I WAS A NURSE IN THE FRONT LINES

338
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,734
我从未见过如此不服从命令的行为
DURING THE WAR.

339
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,207
哦，非常感谢。
OH, THANKS VERY MUCH.

340
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,977
你--你-- 做什么样的
WHAT--WHAT-- WHAT SORT OF WORK

341
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,946
工作？
DO YOU DO?

342
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,448
嗯，我从事过各种各样的工作。
WELL, I'VE WORKED AT ALL SORTS OF JOBS.

343
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,283
主要是机械。
MECHANICS, MOSTLY.

344
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,918
我最喜欢关于汽车的工作。
I LIKE WORKING ON CARS THE BEST.

345
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:35,187
挑选新的小部件。
PICKING UP NEW GADGETS FOR THEM.

346
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,355
哦是的。我懂了。
OH, YES. I SEE.

347
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,224
嗯，你现在不工作吗？
WELL, YOU'RE NOT WORKING NOW?

348
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,959
不。
NO.

349
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,528
您是怎么认识弗伦奇夫人的？
HOW DID YOU GET TO KNOW MRS. FRENCH?

350
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,896
在牛津街。
ON OXFORD STREET.

351
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,032
有一天，我——我——我看到了一位老太太
ONE DAY, I--I-- I SAW THIS OLD LADY

352
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,935
拿着很多——老太太？
CARRYING A LOT OF-- OLD LADY?

353
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,903
嗯，她已经 50 多岁了，不是吗？
WELL, SHE WAS IN HER 50s, WASN'T SHE?

354
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,139
嗯，她带着很多包裹，
WELL, SHE'S CARRYING A LOT OF PACKAGES,

355
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,374
然后，就在街中央，
AND THEN, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET,

356
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:57,776
她的包裹掉了。
SHE DROPPED THEM.

357
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,144
她正试着捡起来，
SHE WAS TRYING TO PICK THEM UP,

358
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,312
我看到一辆公共汽车朝她驶来。
AND I SAW THIS BUS COMING TOWARDS HER.

359
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:01,813
我对她大喊
I YELLED AT HER

360
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,415
她竭力躲到路边。
AND SHE MANAGED TO GET TO THE CURB IN TIME.

361
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,150
那么？然后呢？
WELL? AND THEN?

362
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,519
好吧，我帮她捡起包裹。
WELL, I PICKED UP THE PACKAGES FOR HER.

363
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,553
我擦掉上面的泥土。
I WIPED SOME OF THE MUD OFF.

364
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,821
我试图让她平静下来。
I TRIED TO CALM HER DOWN.

365
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,389
我想她一定很感激。
I PRESUME SHE WAS GRATEFUL.

366
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,358
哦，你一定以为我想救她的命。
OH, YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT I'D TRIED TO SAVE HER LIFE.

367
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,826
后来呢？
AND THEN?

368
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,394
好吧，然后她请我去她家里。
WELL, THEN SHE ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HER.

369
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:17,963
那么你去了吗？
AND SO YOU WENT?

370
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,931
嗯，我认为拒绝会很不礼貌，
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RUDE TO REFUSE,

371
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,868
她看起来很孤独。
AND SHE SEEMED VERY LONELY.

372
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,470
她的丈夫曾在殖民地服役
HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN IN THE COLONIAL SERVICE

373
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,839
并于 45 岁时去世。
AND DIED AT THE AGE OF 45.

374
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,241
嗯，可怜的家伙。心脏病发作。
MMM, POOR GUY. HEART ATTACK.

375
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,109
拜托。
PLEASE.

376
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,178
别在我抽烟的时候提这个。
NOT WHILE I'M SMOKING.

377
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,115
所以...
AND SO...

378
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,783
接着...
WELL...

379
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,421
然后——然后……
AND--AND THEN...

380
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,524
你和她见面
YOU SAW HER

381
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,592
相当——经常地
QUITE-- QUITE FREQUENTLY.

382
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,428
是的，我们，嗯，
YEAH, WE'D, UM,

383
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,163
喝一口雪利酒，然后，呃，
SIP SHERRY AND, UH,

384
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,832
玩卡纳斯塔。
PLAY CANASTA.

385
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,500
你知道，这真的很奇怪
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY WEIRD

386
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,869
现在想想她——
TO THINK OF HER NOW--

387
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,005
躺在客厅里，
LYING THERE IN THAT LIVING ROOM,

388
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:01,106
被谋杀了。
MURDERED.

389
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,107
哦，我向你保证，
OH, I ASSURE YOU,

390
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,075
他们现在已经把她转移了。
THEY HAVE MOVED HER BY NOW.

391
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,379
如果不这样做，那就是无情且非法的……
NOT TO HAVE DONE SO WOULD BE UNFEELING AND UNLAWFUL...

392
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,047
不卫生。
UNSANITARY.

393
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,384
呃，你-你说他在她家里
UH, Y-YOU SAY THAT HE WAS IN HER PLACE

394
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,885
就在谋杀当晚？
ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?

395
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,921
哦，是的，但我在 9:30 之前离开了。
OH, YES, BUT I LEFT BEFORE 9:30.

396
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,389
管家声称艾米丽·奇伦弗
THE HOUSEKEEPER CLAIMED THAT EMILY FRENCH

397
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,558
当她 10:00 回来时，她还活着。
WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN SHE CAME BACK AT 10:00.

398
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:21,560
你从她那里骗了多少钱？
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU GET OUT OF HER?

399
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,061
没有什么。一分钱都没有。
NOTHING. NOT A CENT.

400
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,329
真相。
THE TRUTH.

401
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,797
多少？
HOW MUCH?

402
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,032
她为什么要给我钱？
WHY SHOULD SHE GIVE ME ANY MONEY?

403
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,366
因为她爱你。
BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

404
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,335
（笑）
( laughs )

405
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,503
对不起，先生。
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

406
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,305
这太荒谬了。
IT JUST-- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

407
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:34,539
她喜欢我。
SHE LIKED ME.

408
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,441
她，嗯……
SHE, UM...

409
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,810
是啊，她还纵容我——
YEAH, SHE EVEN PAMPERED ME--

410
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,312
像阿姨一样——但仅此而已。
LIKE AN AUNT-- BUT THAT'S ALL.

411
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:41,947
我发誓。
I SWEAR IT.

412
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,149
你为什么不告诉她你是已婚男人？
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN?

413
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,183
哦，我确实告诉过她了。
OH, I DID TELL HER.

414
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,218
你带你妻子去看她了吗？
DID YOU TAKE YOUR WIFE TO SEE HER?

415
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,253
不。
NO.

416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,521
为什么不？
WHY NOT?

417
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,057
嗯，因为。呃……
WELL, BECAUSE. UH...

418
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,994
好吧，她的印象里
WELL, SHE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

419
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,897
克里斯汀和我相处得不太好。
THAT CHRISTINE AND I DIDN'T GET ALONG TOO WELL.

420
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,332
你给她这样的印象吗？
DID YOU GIVE HER THAT IMPRESSION?

421
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,100
不，她似乎愿意这样相信。
NO, SHE SEEMED TO WANT TO BELIEVE IT THAT WAY.

422
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,570
但你从未纠正过这种印象吗？
BUT YOU NEVER CORRECTED THAT IMPRESSION?

423
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,539
我当时，呃...
I WAS, UH...

424
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,773
担心她会对我失去兴趣。
AFRAID SHE'D LOSE INTEREST IN ME.

425
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,342
因为她很有钱。
BECAUSE SHE WAS RICH.

426
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:13,378
是的，我想是的。
YES, I SUPPOSE SO.

427
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,847
而你却在追求她的钱。
AND YOU WERE AFTER HER MONEY.

428
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,984
我……对不对？
I... WERE YOU?

429
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,519
是的，在某种程度上，我——我……
YES, IN A WAY, I--I...

430
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,555
我只是希望能得到一笔贷款，仅此而已
I WAS HOPING FOR A LOAN, THAT'S ALL,

431
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,323
为了我的一项发明。
FOR AN INVENTION OF MINE.

432
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,396
就这样了。
THAT'S ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

433
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,132
有那么糟糕吗？
IS THAT SO BAD?

434
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,035
管家出去了。
THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS OUT.

435
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,503
只有你...
JUST YOU...

436
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,238
还有那个孤独的女人
AND THAT LONELY WOMAN

437
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,108
在空荡荡的房子里。
IN THE EMPTY HOUSE.

438
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:45,176
多么容易——
HOW EASY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO--

439
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,778
不！
NO!

440
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,446
当我离开她时，她还活着。
WHEN I LEFT HER, SHE WAS ALIVE.

441
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,183
我知道眼下我状况不佳，
I KNOW THINGS DO LOOK BAD FOR ME,

442
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,887
但我向上帝发誓我没杀人。
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T DO IT.

443
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,390
你相信我，不是吗？
YOU DO BELIEVE ME, DON'T YOU?

444
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,161
不，你错了，沃尔先生。
NO, YOU'RE WRONG, MR. VOLE.

445
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,064
你并非状况不佳。
THINGS DON'T LOOK BAD FOR YOU.

446
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,401
而是糟糕透顶。
THEY LOOK ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

447
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,536
你没有不在场证明，
YOU'VE NO ALIBI,

448
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,271
没有证人。
NO WITNESS.

449
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,906
只是我的妻子。
JUST MY WIFE.

450
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,175
一位忠诚妻子的见证，
THE TESTIMONY OF A DEVOTED WIFE,

451
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,244
我担心，效果无足轻重。
I'M AFRAID, DOES NOT CARRY MUCH WEIGHT.

452
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,481
啊，布罗根摩尔。
AH, BROGAN-MOORE.

453
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,849
进来，进来。
COME IN, COME IN.

454
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,117
很高兴看到你出院。
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

455
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,619
他们很高兴摆脱我。
THEY WERE GLAD TO GET RID OF ME.

456
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,921
啊，你认识梅休。
AH, YOU KNOW MAYHEW.

457
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,489
这是他的客户，
THIS IS HIS CLIENT,

458
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,525
先生。伦纳德·沃尔。
MR. LEONARD VOLE.

459
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,826
艾米丽·法兰西谋杀案。
THE EMILY FRENCH MURDER.

460
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,594
是吗？你好。
INDEED. HOW DO YOU DO?

461
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,830
威尔弗雷德爵士：啊，我看不太好。
Sir Wilfred: AH, NOT TOO WELL, I'M AFRAID.

462
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,365
他没有不在场证明，是个烫手山芋。
HE'S NO ALIBI. HE'S A HOT POTATO.

463
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,567
我要把他送到你手上。
I'M DELIVERING IT RIGHT IN YOUR LAP.

464
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,202
多谢。
MUCH OBLIGED.

465
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,604
那么，你最好的辩护就是缺乏动机。
WELL, YOUR BEST DEFENSE WILL BE LACK OF MOTIVE.

466
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,406
如果他靠她养活自己，
IF HE'S SPONGING ON HER,

467
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,507
为什么要杀掉她？
WHY KILL HER OFF?

468
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,076
没有动机。
NO MOTIVE.

469
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,343
没有钱，我恐怕。
NO MONEY, I'M AFRAID.

470
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,346
您必须就您的费用提起诉讼。
YOU WILL HAVE TO SUE FOR YOUR FEES.

471
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,849
我会留置他的 80,000 英镑。
I'LL SIMPLY PUT A LIEN ON HIS £80,000.

472
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,984
什么 80,000 英镑？
WHAT £80,000?

473
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,387
什么，弗伦奇夫人留给你的 80,000 英镑。
WHY, THE £80,000 THAT MRS. FRENCH LEFT YOU.

474
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,055
留给我？
LEFT ME?

475
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,458
今天早上找到了她的遗嘱。
THEY FOUND HER WILL THIS MORNING.

476
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,194
恭喜你。
CONGRATULATIONS.

477
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,796
天哪，你一定是在开玩笑。
MY GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING.

478
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,332
80,000 英镑？
EIGHTY?

479
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,401
我简直不敢相信。
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

480
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,336
我得马上打电话给克里斯汀。
I'VE GOT TO CALL CHRISTINE RIGHT AWAY.

481
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,975
这个遗产...
THIS INHERITANCE...

482
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,478
不会让我的现状更好，不是吗？
DOESN'T MAKE THINGS LOOK ANY BETTER FOR ME, DOES IT?

483
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,279
我不这么认为。
I WOULDN'T THINK SO.

484
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,082
所以，现在他们会说我确实有动机。
SO, NOW THEY'LL SAY I DID HAVE A MOTIVE.

485
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,418
我想 80,000 英镑
I WOULD THINK £80,000

486
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,087
是一个非常美好的动机。
A VERY HANDSOME MOTIVE.

487
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,823
对不起，先生。
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

488
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,458
这里有两位先生
THERE ARE TWO GENTLEMEN HERE

489
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,026
找沃尔先生。
ASKING FOR MR. VOLE.

490
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,595
警察？是的先生。
THE POLICE? YES, SIR.

491
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,030
告诉他们进来。是的。
TELL THEM TO COME IN. YES.

492
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,301
我的上帝。因为遗产吗？
MY GOD. IS THIS IT?

493
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,970
我恐怕可能是这样，我的孩子。
I'M AFRAID IT MAY BE, MY BOY.

494
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,139
但我不知道她会给我留下任何钱。
BUT I HAD NO IDEA SHE'D LEAVE ME ANY MONEY.

495
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,373
这怎么可能是动机呢？
HOW COULD IT BE A MOTIVE?

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,875
现在，别担心，布罗根摩尔先生
NOW, DON'T WORRY, MR. BROGAN-MOORE

497
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,810
会在法庭上说明这些情况。
WILL BRING ALL THAT OUT IN COURT.

498
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,946
啊。赫恩总督察。
AH. CHIEF INSPECTOR HEARNE.

499
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,282
恭喜您晋升。
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION.

500
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,850
哦，好吧，谢谢您，威尔弗雷德爵士。
OH, WELL, THANK YOU, SIR WILFRED.

501
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,352
很抱歉来您房间打扰您。
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU IN YOUR CHAMBERS.

502
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:08,486
不，不用客气。
NO, NOT AT ALL.

503
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,623
你们的危险分子沃尔先生在这里。
WE HAVE YOUR DANGEROUS MR. VOLE HERE.

504
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,324
你是伦纳德·沃尔？
YOU ARE LEONARD VOLE?

505
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,826
是的。
YES.

506
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,327
我有逮捕令，你被控
I HAVE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST

507
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,963
谋杀了艾米丽·弗伦奇。
ON THE CHARGE OF MURDERING ONE EMILY FRENCH.

508
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,999
我必须警告你，你所说的一切
I MUST WARN YOU, ANYTHING YOU SAY

509
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,935
将被记录并可能用作证据。
WILL BE TAKEN DOWN AND MAYBE USED IN EVIDENCE.

510
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,937
对不起。
PARDON ME.

511
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,872
我从未被捕过。
I'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

512
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,007
我必须戴上手铐吗？
DO I HAVE TO BE HANDCUFFED?

513
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:30,341
没有必要。
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

514
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,643
梅休：我会和你一起去车站，
Mayhew: I'LL GO TO THE STATION WITH YOU,

515
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,077
确保你被妥善羁押。
SEE YOU'RE PROPERLY CHARGED.

516
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,979
你能向我妻子解释一下吗？
WILL YOU EXPLAIN TO MY WIFE?

517
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,147
是的当然。
YES, OF COURSE.

518
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,555
我不敢相信这发生的一切。
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

519
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,599
好吧。
WELL.

520
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,903
你给他做了单片眼镜测试吗？
DID YOU GIVE HIM YOUR MONOCLE TEST?

521
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,104
是的，我做了。
YES, I DID.

522
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,974
然后呢？奇怪的是，
AND? CURIOUSLY ENOUGH,

523
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,443
他出色地通过了测试。
HE CAME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS.

524
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,345
唔。
HMM.

525
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,280
卡特：呃，对不起，威尔弗雷德爵士，
Carter: UH, EXCUSE ME, SIR WILFRED,

526
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,450
但普利姆索尔小姐已发出最后通牒。
BUT MISS PLIMSOLL HAS ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM.

527
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,485
如果您一分钟内还没有上床睡觉，
IF YOU'RE NOT IN BED IN ONE MINUTE,

528
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:15,520
她就要辞职。
SHE WILL RESIGN.

529
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,121
（抱怨）
( grumbles )

530
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:20,158
先生，如果您拒绝好好照顾自己，
IF YOU REFUSE TO TAKE PROPER CARE OF YOURSELF, SIR,

531
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,394
我也将被迫辞职。
I WILL BE FORCED TO RESIGN, TOO.

532
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,663
你们是在敲诈。
BLACKMAIL.

533
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,201
好吧，卡特。
ALL RIGHT, CARTER.

534
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:34,405
我会安静地去睡。
I'LL GO QUIETLY.

535
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,510
今天早上有点忙。
IT'S BEEN A BIT HECTIC THIS MORNING.

536
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,983
啊，普利姆索尔小姐，
AH, MISS PLIMSOLL,

537
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,951
你看起来多么迷人啊。
HOW ALLURING YOU LOOK.

538
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,319
就像笼中的眼镜蛇一样。
LIKE A CAGED COBRA.

539
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,555
我又怎能拒绝你啊？
HOW DO I MANAGE TO RESIST YOU?

540
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,090
呃，威尔弗雷德，
UH, WILFRED,

541
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,925
您想询问一下沃尔先生的妻子？
WOULD YOU CARE TO QUESTION MR. VOLE'S WIFE?

542
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,860
抱歉，我没心情
SORRY, I'M IN NO CONDITION

543
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,196
面对哭泣的女人。
TO COPE WITH WEEPING WOMEN.

544
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,431
您需要一打手帕。
YOU'LL WANT A DOZEN HANDKERCHIEFS.

545
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,467
克里斯汀：不。
Christine: NO.

546
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:06,037
根本不需要。
THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.

547
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,641
克里斯汀：你们好？
Christine: HOW DO YOU DO?

548
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,478
我是克里斯汀·沃尔。
I AM CHRISTINE VOLE.

549
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,647
恩...
WELL...

550
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,116
我是威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨。
I'M WILFRED ROBARTS.

551
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:21,386
这是布罗根摩尔先生。
THIS IS MR. BROGAN-MOORE.

552
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:24,522
恐怕有一些相当坏的消息要告诉你。
THERE'S SOME RATHER BAD NEWS FOR YOU, I'M AFRAID.

553
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,257
不要害怕。
DON'T BE AFRAID.

554
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,092
我能承受。
I'M QUITE DISCIPLINED.

555
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,561
他被逮捕了，对吗？
HE'S BEEN ARRESTED, HASN'T HE?

556
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,263
被指控谋杀？
AND CHARGED WITH MURDER?

557
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,933
我对他说过他会被捕。
I TOLD HIM HE WOULD BE.

558
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:40,104
你表现出了非凡的毅力。
YOU SHOW EXTRAORDINARY FORTITUDE.

559
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,342
我的朋友
MY FRIEND HERE

560
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,911
将为您丈夫辩护。
WILL TAKE ON YOUR HUSBAND'S DEFENSE.

561
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,413
哦？
OH?

562
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:53,918
你不会亲自为伦纳德辩护吗？
YOU WILL NOT PERSONALLY DEFEND LEONARD?

563
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,486
嗯，很遗憾我不能。
WELL, REGRETTABLY NOT.

564
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,921
我的健康，你能看到。
MY HEALTH, YOU SEE.

565
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,691
我听过你被人称作
I'VE HEARD YOU DESCRIBED

566
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,260
“绝望中唯一的希望”。
AS THE "CHAMPION OF THE HOPELESS CAUSE."

567
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,396
也许这一次...
PERHAPS THIS CAUSE...

568
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,332
希望太渺茫了。
IS TOO HOPELESS.

569
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,510
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

570
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,093
我打算与哈里森博士
I INTEND TO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS DISCUSSION

571
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,561
进行一次非常认真的讨论
WITH DR. HARRISON.

572
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,262
让你回到这里是一个巨大的错误。
IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE TO LET YOU COME BACK HERE.

573
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,897
我应该直接带您去
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU

574
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:41,866
某个遥远的度假村，
DIRECTLY TO SOME FAR OFF RESORT,

575
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,034
比如百慕大。
LIKE BERMUDA.

576
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,235
不行。
NEVER.

577
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,870
你只是想看我
YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ME

578
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,672
穿着令人讨厌的小短裤。
IN THOSE NASTY LITTLE SHORTS.

579
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,942
现在。
NOW.

580
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,144
如果您愿意的话，请穿上这些。
PUT THESE ON, IF YOU PLEASE.

581
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,280
上衣和裤子。
BOTH TOPS AND BOTTOMS.

582
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:58,449
我来帮你整理床铺。
I'LL MAKE YOUR BED.

583
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,385
我必须说，
I MUST SAY,

584
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,554
我觉得沃尔先生相当可怜
I FEEL RATHER SORRY FOR MR. VOLE.

585
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,922
他妻子的声音
THAT WIFE OF HIS

586
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,457
听上去非常可怕。
SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY HORRID.

587
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,192
一个外国人。
THAT FOREIGNER.

588
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,927
我认为英国女孩
I THINK ENGLISH GIRLS

589
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,263
更加贴心
ARE SO MUCH MORE CARING

590
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,465
而且明智。
AND SENSIBLE.

591
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,902
我的母亲——哦，我来自多塞特郡——
MY MOTHER--OH, I COME FROM DORSET--

592
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,370
我妈妈常说
MY MOTHER USED TO SAY

593
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,974
没有一个自尊的多塞特人
THAT NO SELF-RESPECTING DORSET MAN

594
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,343
会梦想娶一个外国人。
WOULD EVER DREAM OF MARRYING A FOREIGNER.

595
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,212
您曾在多塞特郡住过吗？
HAVE YOU EVER STAYED IN DORSET?

596
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,481
哦，我真的很喜欢它。
OH, I DO SO LOVE IT.

597
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,618
多么幸福、多么幸福的童年啊。
SUCH A HAPPY, HAPPY CHILDHOOD.

598
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:35,053
哦是的。哇！
OH, YES. WHEW!

599
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,154
好吧，我现在的职业生涯
WELL, MY CAREER NOW

600
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,688
带我到过很多地方
TAKES ME TO SO MANY PLACES

601
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,291
我都没有时间想家了。
I HAVE NO TIME TO BE HOMESICK.

602
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:44,462
不，不，那不是真的。
NO, NO, THAT ISN'T TRUE.

603
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,632
有时我只是感觉...
SOMETIMES I FEEL JUST...

604
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,967
很孤独，你知道的。
SO LONELY, YOU KNOW.

605
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,970
太孤单了。
SO LONELY.

606
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:56,074
哦，但人必须保持忙碌。
OH, BUT ONE MUST KEEP BUSY.

607
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,475
保持活跃。
ONE MUST KEEP ACTIVE.

608
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,011
我想你会同意我的观点。
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME THERE.

609
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,646
这真是太有意义了，你知道，
IT'S SO REWARDING, YOU KNOW,

610
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:03,247
参与服务
TO BE IN THE SERVICE

611
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,217
给需要专业护理的人。
OF THOSE WHO NEED PROFESSIONAL CARE.

612
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,224
你喜欢鱼吗？
DO YOU LIKE FISH?

613
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:17,261
我们所有人都必须做我们最擅长的事情
ALL OF US MUST DO WHAT WE DO BEST

614
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,263
在这世上。
IN THIS WORLD.

615
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,265
所以我——
AND SO I REMAIN--

616
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,268
还是挺满足...
CONTENT...

617
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,405
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

618
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,574
去俱乐部吧，威廉姆斯。
TO THE CLUB, WILLIAMS.

619
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,242
是的先生。
YES, SIR.

620
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,480
（敲击窗户）
( rapping on window )

621
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,316
威尔弗雷德爵士：请原谅我的匆忙，
Sir Wilfred: FORGIVE MY HASTE,

622
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,283
但我的护士可能骑着扫帚
BUT MY NURSE MIGHT BE FOLLOWING

623
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,319
跟过来。
ON HER BROOMSTICK.

624
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:55,066
威尔弗雷德爵士： 我说明白了吗，沃尔夫人,
Sir Wilfred: AM I TO UNDERSTAND, MRS. VOLE,

625
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,135
你丈夫的全部辩护
THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S ENTIRE DEFENSE

626
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,370
取决于他的和你的证词？
DEPENDS ON HIS WORD AND YOURS?

627
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,006
不幸的是，陪审团
UNFORTUNATELY, A JURY

628
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,242
经常对一个被控谋杀的男人
IS OFTEN SKEPTICAL OF A MAN

629
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,910
持怀疑态度
ACCUSED OF MURDER

630
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,445
如果只有他深爱的妻子
SUPPORTED ONLY BY THE WORD

631
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,980
的证词来支持。
OF HIS ADORING WIFE.

632
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,715
是这样的。
ALWAYS.

633
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:12,250
梅休：确实如此。他说得很对。
Mayhew: INDEED. HE'S QUITE RIGHT.

634
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:13,317
哦，我说！
OH, I SAY!

635
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,753
这些不美吗？
AREN'T THESE BEAUTIES?

636
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,655
是的，好吧——不，不，你继续，
YES, WELL-- NO, NO, YOU GO ON,

637
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,723
我亲爱的朋友。
MY DEAR FELLOW.

638
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,224
询问这位迷人的女士。
QUESTION THIS CHARMING LADY.

639
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,293
我——我不会打扰你。
I--I WON'T INTERRUPT YOU.

640
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,095
（ 清嗓子 ）
( clears throat )

641
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,597
好吧...
YES, WELL...

642
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,765
我明白了，
I TAKE IT, THEN,

643
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,333
你知道你的丈夫
THAT YOU KNEW THAT YOUR HUSBAND

644
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,402
一直在和弗伦奇夫人定期私会
HAD BEEN SEEING MRS. FRENCH REGULARLY.

645
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,437
我从那天起就知道了
I KNEW IT FROM THE DAY

646
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:35,907
他带着一双绿袜子回家
HE CAME HOME WITH A PAIR OF GREEN SOCKS

647
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:37,975
她为他编织的。
SHE HAD KNITTED FOR HIM.

648
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,210
我懂了。
I SEE.

649
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,478
一双袜子。
A PAIR OF SOCKS.

650
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,280
嗯，这很自然。
WELL, THAT'S, UH, QUITE NATURAL.

651
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,115
讨人喜欢的家伙。
ALMOST ENDEARING.

652
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,417
伦纳德非常讨人喜欢。
LEONARD CAN BE VERY ENDEARING.

653
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,519
他对女人很有一套。
HE HAS A WAY WITH WOMEN.

654
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,790
我只希望他的陪审团全部是女性。
I ONLY HOPE HE WILL HAVE AN ALL-WOMAN JURY.

655
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,326
我们将会胜利地被无罪释放。
WE WILL BE ACQUITTED IN TRIUMPH.

656
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,329
你知道她在遗嘱里给他留下了钱吗？
YOU KNEW SHE'D LEFT HIM MONEY IN HER WILL?

657
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,364
一大笔钱。
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

658
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,968
你的丈夫以前对此一无所知。
YOUR HUSBAND HAD NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

659
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:07,738
这是他告诉你的吗？
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

660
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,540
您肯定没有提出任何不同的建议吗？
SURELY YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

661
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,212
我不建议任何事情。
I DO NOT SUGGEST ANYTHING.

662
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,714
很明显...
QUITE OBVIOUSLY...

663
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,082
弗伦奇太太把你的丈夫
MRS. FRENCH LOOKED UPON YOUR HUSBAND

664
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,051
看作儿子或侄子。
AS A SON OR A NEPHEW.

665
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,853
（笑声）
( chuckles )

666
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,490
天哪，你在这个国家真是个伪君子。
MY GOD, WHAT HYPOCRITES YOU ARE IN THIS COUNTRY.

667
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:30,928
哦，如果我让你震惊了，我很抱歉，威尔弗雷德爵士。
OH, I'M SORRY IF I SHOCKED YOU, SIR WILFRED.

668
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,697
不，不，一点也不。
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

669
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,966
请继续。
PLEASE GO ON.

670
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,204
这样。
THERE.

671
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,206
对您来说更舒服吗？
IS THAT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR YOU,

672
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,507
威尔弗雷德爵士？
SIR WILFRED?

673
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,947
希望您不要介意这一点。
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND THIS.

674
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,249
医生说
DOCTOR SAID

675
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:52,516
我应该每天散步两次。
I SHOULD TAKE A STROLL TWICE A DAY.

676
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,951
我一点也不介意，
I DON'T MIND IN THE LEAST,

677
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,420
但我不知道还能告诉你什么。
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT MORE I CAN TELL YOU.

678
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,755
好吧，我们回到
WELL, LET'S GO BACK

679
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,724
到谋杀案当晚。
TO THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

680
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,027
你的丈夫在 9:30 之前回到家。
YOUR HUSBAND CAME HOME BEFORE 9:30.

681
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,395
那是对的吗？
IS THAT CORRECT?

682
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,063
他是这么说的吗？
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

683
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,164
是的。
YES.

684
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,499
那么它是正确的。
THEN IT IS CORRECT.

685
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,701
他在 9 点 30 分之前回到家。
HE CAME HOME BEFORE 9:30.

686
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,737
我们想要真相，沃尔夫人。
WE WANT THE TRUTH, MRS. VOLE.

687
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:15,406
您将接受宣誓。
YOU'RE GOING TO BE UNDER OATH.

688
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,743
是的，事实...
YES, THE TRUTH...

689
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,512
除了事实，什么也没有。
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

690
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,356
威尔弗雷德爵士：沃尔夫人,
Sir Wilfred: MRS. VOLE,

691
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,492
你爱你的丈夫吗？
DO YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND?

692
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,728
伦纳德认为我愿意。
LEONARD THINKS I DO.

693
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,497
那么，你呢？
WELL, AND DO YOU?

694
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,932
我已经宣誓了吗？
AM I ALREADY UNDER OATH?

695
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,301
沃尔太太,
MRS. VOLE,

696
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,236
无论你的策略是什么，
WHATEVER YOUR GAMBIT MAY BE,

697
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,139
你知道根据英国法律
DO YOU KNOW THAT UNDER ENGLISH LAW

698
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,007
你不能提供证词
YOU CANNOT GIVE TESTIMONY

699
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,709
反对你的丈夫？
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND?

700
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,947
多么方便啊。
HOW VERY CONVENIENT.

701
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,316
检方
THE PROSECUTION

702
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,518
会试图绞死你的丈夫——
WILL ATTEMPT TO HANG YOUR HUSBAND--

703
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:03,421
一个爱你的丈夫。
A HUSBAND WHO LOVES YOU.

704
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,856
爱我？
LOVES ME?

705
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:09,260
伦纳德崇拜我走过的土地。
LEONARD WORSHIPS THE GROUND I WALK ON.

706
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,095
我假设
I ASSUME

707
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,464
你也同样爱他吗？
THAT YOU LOVE HIM AS MUCH?

708
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,734
你想知道的太多了。
YOU WANT TO KNOW TOO MUCH.

709
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,938
再见（德语），先生们。
AUF WIEDERSEHEN, GENTLEMEN.

710
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,840
不用担心。
DON'T WORRY.

711
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,209
如果伦纳德需要不在场证明
IF LEONARD NEEDS AN ALIBI,

712
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,445
我会非常有说服力。
I SHALL BE VERY CONVINCING.

713
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:29,013
我的眼里将会有泪水
THERE WILL BE TEARS IN MY EYES

714
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,881
当我作证的时候。
WHEN I SPEAK.

715
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,950
你是一个非常了不起的女人，
YOU ARE A VERY REMARKABLE WOMAN,

716
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,151
沃尔太太。
MRS. VOLE.

717
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,221
那么我希望，
AND YOU ARE SATISFIED,

718
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,056
您们会满意？
I HOPE?

719
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,264
满意的话我就下地狱。
I'M DAMNED IF I'M SATISFIED.

720
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,801
威尔弗雷德爵士：我希望得到您最诚实的评价。
Sir Wilfred: I WANT YOUR HONEST APPRAISAL.

721
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,970
您认为伦纳德·沃尔是无辜的吗？
DO YOU THINK LEONARD VOLE IS INNOCENT?

722
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,338
我不知道。
I DON'T KNOW.

723
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,006
对不起，
I'M SORRY,

724
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:58,109
但当然，我会尽力而为。
BUT OF COURSE, I'LL DO MY VERY BEST.

725
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,744
（叹气）
( sighs )

726
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,481
你不必担心自己。
YOU NEEDN'T CONCERN YOURSELF.

727
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:06,117
我将从这里开始。
I SHALL TAKE IT ON FROM HERE.

728
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,458
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

729
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,294
您可能想知道
YOU MAY WISH TO KNOW

730
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,263
我已经打电话给哈里森博士了。
THAT I HAVE CALLED DR. HARRISON

731
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,298
并向他提供了完整的报告
AND GIVEN HIM A COMPLETE REPORT

732
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,067
关于你令人震惊的行为。
ON YOUR SHOCKING BEHAVIOR.

733
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,368
给我一根火柴。
GIVE ME A MATCH.

734
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,936
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

735
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,406
你听到我说的话了吗？
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

736
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,274
给我...
GIVE ME...

737
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,143
一根火柴。
A MATCH.

738
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,114
（划火柴声）
( match strikes )

739
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,971
先生。梅休。
MR. MAYHEW.

740
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,107
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

741
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,508
我想让您知道
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

742
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,810
我是多么感激，先生，
HOW GRATEFUL I AM, SIR,

743
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,411
你将代表我。
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO REPRESENT ME.

744
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,479
好吧，我已经和我的医生们
WELL, I'VE STRUCK A BARGAIN

745
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,947
谈妥了条件。
WITH MY DOCTORS.

746
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,982
他们会让我继续处理这个案子
THEY'LL LET ME GO ON WITH THE CASE

747
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,018
然后我得去百慕大休假六个月。
IF I GO OFF FOR SIX MONTHS TO BERMUDA.

748
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,286
谢谢您，先生。
THANK YOU, SIR.

749
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,822
希望我们在这个案子上都能顺利。
LET'S HOPE WE'LL BOTH BE THE BETTER FOR IT.

750
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,191
梅休 ：请你穿上这些好吗？
Mayhew: WOULD YOU PUT THESE ON, PLEASE?

751
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,028
做什么？
WHAT FOR?

752
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,563
因为这些是你
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE CLOTHES

753
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:26,831
在谋杀案发生当晚所穿的衣服。
YOU WORE ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

754
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:28,232
我们将分发一张照片，
WE'LL CIRCULATE A PHOTOGRAPH,

755
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,767
并希望可能有证人
AND HOPE THAT A WITNESS

756
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,435
看到你离开弗伦奇夫家
MIGHT HAVE SEEN YOU LEAVING MRS. FRENCH

757
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,938
以便确认时间。
TO VERIFY THE TIME.

758
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,272
摄影师：请在窗边。
Photographer: BY THE WINDOW, PLEASE.

759
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,707
我们真的需要这个吗？
DO WE REALLY NEED THIS?

760
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,978
呃，戴上帽子，好吗？
UH, HAT, PLEASE?

761
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,048
我妻子知道我什么时候回家。
MY WIFE KNOWS WHAT TIME I CAME HOME.

762
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:46,750
摄影师：请再来一张个人资料。
Photographer: ONE MORE IN PROFILE, PLEASE.

763
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:48,085
我就是不明白
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND

764
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,087
为什么克里斯汀没有来看我。
WHY CHRISTINE HASN'T COME TO SEE ME.

765
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,756
已经一个多星期了。
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK.

766
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:54,391
梅休 ：我稍后去取底片，谢谢。
Mayhew: I'LL PICK UP THE NEGATIVES LATER, THANK YOU.

767
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,126
好的。
RIGHT.

768
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,796
现在，等一下。
NOW, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

769
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,065
你有事瞒着我吗？
ARE YOU KEEPING SOMETHING FROM ME?

770
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,034
克里斯汀还好吗？
IS CHRISTINE ALL RIGHT?

771
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,936
考虑到所有事情，沃尔先生,
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, MR. VOLE,

772
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,372
我认为你妻子能接受一切。
I THINK YOUR WIFE'S TAKEN IT VERY WELL.

773
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,174
这对她来说一定很艰难。
IT MUST BE DAMN TOUGH ON HER.

774
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:15,212
我们以前从未分开过。
WE'VE NEVER BEEN SEPARATED BEFORE.

775
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,514
自从我们第一次见面以来。
NOT SINCE WE FIRST MET.

776
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,148
是在德国吗？
WAS THAT IN GERMANY?

777
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:19,483
正确的。
RIGHT.

778
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,885
我在空军，
I WAS WITH THE AIR FORCE,

779
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,486
驻扎在汉堡郊外。
STATIONED OUTSIDE OF HAMBURG.

780
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,488
我在夜总会遇见她。
I MET HER IN A NIGHTCLUB.

781
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,423
她在坐在桌前
SHE WAS WAITING ON TABLES

782
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,292
希望找到另一份工作——
AND HOPING TO LAND ANOTHER JOB--

783
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,527
在剧院表演。
ACTING IN THE THEATER.

784
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,628
你把她带到这里来了？
AND YOU BROUGHT HER OVER HERE?

785
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,463
是的，我，呃，租了一套公寓
YES, I, UH, RENTED A FLAT

786
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,431
在伯爵宫路。
ON EARL'S COURT ROAD.

787
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,200
还有，呃...
AND, UH...

788
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,036
当她第一次看到它时，
WHEN SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME,

789
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,771
她很高兴。
SHE WAS SO HAPPY.

790
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,339
她崩溃流泪了。
SHE JUST BROKE DOWN AND CRIED.

791
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,607
很温馨啊。
HEARTWARMING.

792
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,443
她在战争中失去了所有家人。
SHE LOST ALL HER FAMILY IN THE WAR.

793
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,411
我就是她的全部。
I'M ALL SHE HAS.

794
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,380
哦，是的，是的。
OH, YES, YES.

795
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:51,081
我明白。
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

796
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,118
你真的不知道她对我如何，
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT ME,

797
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,287
但当她作证时你就会知道。
BUT YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN SHE TESTIFIES.

798
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,788
沃尔先生,
MR. VOLE,

799
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,523
我不会把你的妻子
I'M NOT PUTTING YOUR WIFE

800
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,725
在证人席里。
IN THE WITNESS BOX.

801
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,328
为什么不？
WHY NOT?

802
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,864
她是外国人。
SHE'S A FOREIGNER.

803
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,866
因为我们语言的复杂性——
THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR LANGUAGE--

804
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,302
检方可能...
PROSECUTION MIGHT...

805
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,770
抓住她的漏洞。
CATCH HER UP.

806
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:15,773
听说检方可能安排迈尔斯上庭。
WE HEAR IT MAY BE MYERS FOR THE PROSECUTION.

807
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,142
我们不能冒任何风险。
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.

808
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,276
他很厉害吗？
HE'S GOOD?

809
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,811
很难对付。
FORMIDABLE.

810
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,547
令人恼火的男人，迈尔斯先生。
IRRITATING MAN, MR. MYERS.

811
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,150
但击败他会
I'D TAKE GREAT PLEASURE

812
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,252
让我很高兴。
IN BEATING HIM.

813
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,154
长官？
OFFICER?

814
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,822
必须让克里斯汀作证！
BUT CHRISTINE MUST GIVE EVIDENCE!

815
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,424
你要相信我，
YOU MUST TRUST ME,

816
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,293
因为我是一个刻薄、坏脾气的
IF ONLY BECAUSE I'M A MEAN, ILL-TEMPERED OLD MAN

817
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,162
又憎恨失败的老头子
WHO HATES TO LOSE.

818
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:40,931
让我们祝彼此好运。
LET US WISH EACH OTHER GOOD LUCK.

819
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,533
威尔弗雷德爵士，您不明白。
SIR WILFRED, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

820
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,735
没有克里斯汀我就无法面对这一切！
I CAN'T FACE THIS WITHOUT CHRISTINE!

821
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,605
沃尔 ：我需要她！
Vole: I NEED HER!

822
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,306
没有她，我就完了！
WITHOUT HER, I'M SUNK!

823
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,842
你明白吗？
YOU UNDERSTAND?

824
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,410
确实非常感人，
IT'S REALLY RATHER TOUCHING,

825
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,845
他是那么依赖妻子。
THE WAY HE COUNTS ON HIS WIFE.

826
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,847
像一个溺水的人
LIKE A DROWNING MAN

827
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,116
紧握着一把剃刀刀片。
CLUTCHING AT A RAZORBLADE.

828
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,310
（含糊不清的说话声）
( indistinct chatter )

829
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,145
书记员 ：安静！
Clerk: SILENCE!

830
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,416
你的名字是伦纳德·沃尔吗？
IS YOUR NAME LEONARD VOLE?

831
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,218
是的。
YES.

832
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:35,853
您被控在
YOU ARE CHARGED ON INDICTMENT

833
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:39,456
1954 年 9 月 14 日，
THAT ON THE 14th DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 1954,

834
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,059
谋杀了艾米丽·简·弗伦奇。
YOU MURDERED EMILY JANE FRENCH.

835
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,361
沃尔，你是否认罪？
VOLE, ARE YOU GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?

836
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,297
我无罪。
NOT GUILTY.

837
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,233
（发牢骚、喋喋不休）
( grumbling, chattering )

838
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:52,069
法官：陪审团成员，你们宣誓
Judge: MEMBERS OF THE JURY, YOU ARE SWORN

839
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,104
以证据来审理此案。
TO TRY THIS CASE ON EVIDENCE.

840
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,940
你必须从你的头脑中排除其他一切，
YOU MUST SHUT OUT EVERYTHING FROM YOUR MINDS,

841
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,476
除了本法庭发生的事情。
EXCEPT WHAT TAKES PLACE IN THIS COURT.

842
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:06,150
您可以提起诉讼，迈尔斯先生。
YOU MAY PROCEED FOR THE PROSECUTION, MR. MYERS.

843
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,218
法官大人，请允许我
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,

844
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,286
和我博学的朋友巴顿先生
I APPEAR IN THIS CASE

845
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,789
共同出庭。
WITH MY LEARNED FRIEND, MR. BARTON.

846
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,891
而对于辩方，威尔弗雷德爵士——
AND FOR THE DEFENSE, SIR WILFRED--

847
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:17,327
威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨爵士和布罗根摩尔先生--
SIR WILFRED ROBARTS AND MR. BROGAN-MOORE--

848
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,897
我--我相信今天上午
I--I TRUST WE ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED

849
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,199
我们博学而有趣的威尔弗雷德爵士
OF THE LEARNED AND STIMULATING PRESENCE

850
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,701
不会错过这次开庭吧。
OF SIR WILFRED THIS MORNING?

851
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,836
大人，我可以向我博学的朋友保证
MY LORD, MAY I ASSURE MY LEARNED FRIEND

852
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,805
威尔弗雷德爵士就在老贝利街（注：中央刑事法院所在地，意为“老墙”）
THAT SIR WILFRED IS IN THE OLD BAILEY

853
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,807
并将很快就座。
AND WILL BE IN HIS SEAT SHORTLY.

854
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,942
您可以继续了，迈尔斯先生。
YOU MAY PROCEED, MR. MYERS.

855
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,210
谢谢，大人。
THANK YOU, MY LORD.

856
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,311
（ 清嗓子 ）
( clears throat )

857
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,848
本案的事实非常简单。
THE FACTS IN THIS CASE ARE VERY SIMPLE.

858
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,883
医学证据将证明
MEDICAL TESTIMONY WILL PROVE

859
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,485
艾米丽·弗伦奇夫人
THAT MRS. EMILY FRENCH

860
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,153
被一个钝器重物
WAS MURDERED BY A BLOW

861
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,289
击打致死。
FROM A BLUNT AND HEAVY INSTRUMENT.

862
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:47,958
检方对此案认定
IT IS THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

863
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,860
这一击是被
THAT THIS BLOW WAS STRUCK

864
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,228
犯人——
BY THE PRISONER--

865
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,363
伦纳德·沃尔击打的。
LEONARD VOLE.

866
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,965
太荒唐了。
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

867
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,967
我只是有点紧张性的烧心症状。
JUST A BIT OF NERVOUS HEARTBURN.

868
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,603
庭审的第一天总会这样。
ALWAYS GET IT THE FIRST DAY OF A TRIAL.

869
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,839
240 / 130。
240 OVER 130.

870
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,140
你根本不应该来这里。
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE AT ALL.

871
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,475
我应该站在法庭上。
I SHOULD BE IN THE COURTROOM.

872
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,509
审判已经开始了。
THE TRIAL'S BEGUN.

873
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,045
注射器，普利姆索尔小姐。
SYRINGE, MISS PLIMSOLL.

874
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,113
先生。
SIR.

875
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,249
现在，做一个勇敢的好孩子吧，威尔弗雷德爵士。
NOW, BE A GOOD, BRAVE BOY, SIR WILFRED.

876
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,118
您可能有兴趣知道
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW

877
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,620
我是战士家族的后裔
THAT I AM DESCENDED FROM A WARRIOR FAMILY

878
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,956
它勇敢的过往
WHICH TRACES ITS BRAVE PAST

879
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:20,824
可以追溯到狮心王理查德。
BACK TO RICHARD THE LION-HEARTED.

880
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,060
（哎呦）
( muttering )

881
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,330
您每天都要注射钙剂，
YOU'RE TO HAVE A CALCIUM INJECTION DAILY,

882
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:30,067
每小时一颗安神丸，
A TRANQUILIZING PILL EVERY HOUR,

883
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,137
如果突然感到疼痛或呼吸急促，
AND IN CASE OF A SUDDEN PAIN OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH,

884
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,072
服用一颗硝酸甘油片
POP ONE OF THOSE NITROGLYCERIN TABLETS

885
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,406
放在你的舌下，
IN THE BLACK BOX UNDER YOUR TONGUE,

886
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,142
我也会给你留一些滴剂。
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU SOME DROPS AS WELL.

887
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,843
够了，医生。
THAT'S ENOUGH, DOCTOR.

888
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,513
法官要看我的舌苔怎么样了
THE JUDGE WILL BE ASKING FOR A SALIVA TEST.

889
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,915
啊，我们最好拿上
AH, WE'D BETTER GET

890
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,885
装了可可保温瓶。
THAT THERMOS OF COCOA WITH ME.

891
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,586
好帮吃掉药丸。
HELPS ME TO WASH DOWN THE PILLS.

892
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,323
请让我看一看。
LET ME SEE THAT, PLEASE.

893
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,859
我博学的病人
MY LEARNED PATIENT

894
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,328
可不能用白兰地
IS NOT ABOVE SUBSTITUTING BRANDY

895
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,963
来代替可可。
FOR THE COCOA.

896
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,099
哦！这是可可。
OH! IT IS COCOA.

897
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,234
嗯。非常抱歉。
HMPH. SO SORRY.

898
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,272
是的，保管好这个，卡特。
YES, TAKE CARE OF THAT, CARTER.

899
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,174
哈里森博士：现在，威尔弗雷德爵士，在法庭上
Dr. Harrison: NOW, SIR WILFRED, IN THE COURTROOM

900
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,542
您必须避免过度兴奋。
YOU MUST AVOID OVEREXCITEMENT.

901
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,043
注意你的脾气。
WATCH YOUR TEMPER.

902
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,012
放低嗓音，降低血压。
KEEP BOTH YOUR VOICE AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN.

903
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:16,446
哦，没关系，谢谢你，医生。
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

904
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,849
我服用这些药丸会很安全
I SHALL BE QUITE SAFE WITH THE PILLS

905
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,318
还有可可。
AND THE COCOA.

906
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,221
走吧，卡特。
ALONG, CARTER.

907
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,024
因此我们确定死亡时间
WE THEREFORE PLACE THE TIME OF DEATH

908
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,060
晚上 10:00 至 10:30 之间
BETWEEN 10:00 AND 10:30 P.M.

909
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,563
就在珍妮特·麦肯齐打电话给我们之前。
THAT IS JUST BEFORE JANET MacKENZIE CALLED US.

910
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:33,897
死者颈后
WAS THE SEVERE BLOW

911
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,332
受到的重击
TO THE BACK OF THE NECK

912
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,433
是致死原因吗？
THE CAUSE OF DEATH?

913
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,601
是的，先生。
YES, SIR.

914
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,969
立即死亡
DEATH WAS INSTANTANEOUS

915
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,204
一击毙命
CAUSED BY ONE BLOW

916
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,872
来自钝器重物。
FROM A HEAVY AND BLUNT INSTRUMENT.

917
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,473
没有其他挣扎的迹象吗？
NO OTHER SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE?

918
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,075
不，先生。只有一击。
NO, SIR. ONE BLOW.

919
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,643
这是否表明
WOULD THAT INDICATE TO YOU

920
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,179
谋杀的发生很突然？
THAT THE MURDER HAD TAKEN HER BY SURPRISE?

921
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,080
大人
MY LORD.

922
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,449
我很惊讶于
I'M TAKEN BY SURPRISE

923
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,051
我博学的朋友
THAT MY LEARNED FRIEND

924
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:56,820
应当尝试向证人询问
SHOULD ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT FROM THE WITNESS

925
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,056
一种观点而非事实。
AN OPINION AND NOT A FACT.

926
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,390
法官：确实如此。
Judge: QUITE SO.

927
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,326
迈尔斯先生，看来是威尔弗雷德爵士
MR. MYERS, IT SEEMS THAT SIR WILFRED

928
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:04,895
加入我们正好赶上你
HAS JOINED US JUST IN TIME TO CATCH YOU

929
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,363
关于法律程序的问题。
ON A POINT OF LEGAL PROCEDURE.

930
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,866
请重新表述您的问题。
PLEASE REPHRASE YOUR QUESTION.

931
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:12,002
法官大人，我撤回这个问题。
MY LORD, I WITHDRAW THE QUESTION.

932
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,871
你刚才说
DID YOU SAY

933
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,405
房间给人的印象
THE ROOM GAVE THE IMPRESSION

934
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,274
是发生了抢劫？
THAT A ROBBERY HAD TAKEN PLACE?

935
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,042
赫恩：是的，一扇窗户被打破了
Hearne: YES, A WINDOW WAS BROKEN

936
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,844
地板上有玻璃，
WITH GLASS ON THE FLOOR,

937
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,613
在外面发现了碎片。
AND FRAGMENTS WERE FOUND OUTSIDE.

938
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,014
然而，外面的碎片
FRAGMENTS OUTSIDE, HOWEVER,

939
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,249
与从外部强行
WERE NOT CONSISTENT

940
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:26,984
打开窗户
WITH THE WINDOW HAVING BEEN FORCED

941
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,085
并不一致。
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

942
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,319
所以，你说的意思是
SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

943
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,654
有人视图让
IS THAT SOMEONE HAD ATTEMPTED

944
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,456
现场看起来像是
TO MAKE IT LOOK AS IF THE GLASS

945
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,424
从外部强行进入的吗？
HAD BEEN FORCED FROM THE OUTSIDE?

946
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,426
威尔弗雷德爵士：大人，我必须抗议。
Sir Wilfred: MY LORD, I MUST PROTEST.

947
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,929
我博学的朋友正在
MY LEARNED FRIEND IS PUTTING WORDS

948
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,264
替证人说话。
IN THE WITNESS' MOUTH.

949
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,132
如果他回答自己的问题，
IF HE ANSWERS HIS OWN QUESTIONS,

950
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,402
证人的出庭就是多余的。
THE PRESENCE OF THE WITNESS WILL BE SUPERFLUOUS.

951
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,505
（咯咯笑）
( chuckling )

952
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,973
法官：肃静，肃静。
Judge: QUITE, QUITE.

953
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,608
你不这么认为吗，迈尔斯先生？
DON'T YOU THINK SO, MR. MYERS?

954
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,076
是的，确实如此，大人。
YES, INDEED, MY LORD.

955
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,645
（ 清嗓子 ）
( clears throat )

956
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,980
那位女士的财产是否丢失了？
WAS ANY OF THE LADY'S PROPERTY MISSING?

957
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,949
据管家说，没有。
NOTHING, ACCORDING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER.

958
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,051
先生，按照你的经验
IS IT NOT YOUR EXPERIENCE, SIR,

959
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:05,155
窃贼闯入一所房子
THAT BURGLARS USUALLY BURGLE

960
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,857
通常不都会行窃吗？
WHEN THEY BREAK INTO A HOUSE?

961
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,091
是的先生。
YES, SIR.

962
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,960
巡官，您提取了一件夹克吗？
DO YOU PRODUCE A JACKET, INSPECTOR?

963
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,195
是的先生。
YES, SIR.

964
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,435
那么 -
AND IS--

965
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,070
是这件夹克吗？
IS THAT THE JACKET?

966
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,438
是的，先生。
IT IS, SIR.

967
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,440
我建议标记为--
I PROPOSE THAT THAT BE TAGGED--

968
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,975
“1号物证。”
"EXHIBIT ONE."

969
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,843
你在哪里发现它的，巡官？
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT, INSPECTOR?

970
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,645
在犯人的公寓里发现的。
IT WAS FOUND IN THE PRISONER'S FLAT.

971
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,947
我把它交给我们的实验室
I HANDED IT TO OUR LAB

972
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,015
呃，测试血迹。
TO, UH, TEST FOR BLOOD STAINS.

973
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,850
发现血迹了吗？
DID YOU FIND BLOOD STAINS?

974
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,419
哦，是的，先生，
OH, YES, SIR,

975
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,321
尽管曾经有人企图将血迹洗掉。
THOUGH AN ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO WASH THEM OUT.

976
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:39,389
实验室做了哪些测试？
WHAT TESTS DID THE LABORATORY MAKE?

977
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,526
首先，确定污渍是人血，
FIRST, TO DETERMINE THAT STAINS WERE HUMAN BLOOD,

978
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:44,261
然后，呃，
AND THEN TO, UH,

979
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,029
对血型进行分类。
CLASSIFY THE GROUP OR TYPE.

980
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,965
污渍是特定的血型吗？
AND WERE THE STAINS OF A PARTICULAR TYPE?

981
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,132
哦，是的，先生。
OH, YES, SIR.

982
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,467
是“O”型。
THEY WERE TYPE "O."

983
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,469
你测试过死者的血液吗？
DID YOU TEST THE BLOOD OF THE DEAD WOMAN?

984
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,271
我们做到了，先生。
WE DID, SIR.

985
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,006
也是“O”型。
THAT WAS ALSO TYPE "O."

986
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,841
非常感谢您，督察。
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, INSPECTOR.

987
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,142
威尔弗雷德爵士：巡官。
Sir Wilfred: INSPECTOR.

988
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,311
窃贼难道不可能
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE BURGLAR

989
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,081
进入一间空房子，
MIGHT ENTER AN EMPTY HOUSE,

990
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:08,051
然后突然遇到弗伦奇夫人
AND THEN SUDDENLY ENCOUNTER MRS. FRENCH

991
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,720
动手打她？
AND STRIKE HER?

992
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,955
然后，发现她死了，
AND THEN, DISCOVERING THAT SHE IS DEAD,

993
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,323
恐慌失措然后逃跑，
PANIC, FLEE,

994
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,592
而没有偷走任何东西？
WITHOUT TAKING ANYTHING?

995
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,460
是的，先生，IT——
YES, SIR, IT--

996
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,228
这当然有可能。
IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

997
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,930
法官大人，我必须要说
MY LORD, I MUST SUBMIT

998
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,431
在脑子里虚构一个
THAT IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE

999
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,266
完全想象出来的窃贼
TO GUESS WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIND

1000
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,069
是完全不可能的。
OF AN ENTIRELY IMAGINARY BURGLAR.

1001
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,804
法官：你说得很对，迈尔斯先生。
Judge: YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, MR. MYERS.

1002
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,973
请让我们以事实为依据，
PLEASE LET US CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE FACTS,

1003
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,475
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

1004
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,477
当你审问囚犯时
WHEN YOU QUESTIONED THE PRISONER

1005
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:35,245
至于他夹克上的血迹，
AS TO THE STAINS ON HIS JACKET,

1006
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,980
他没有给你看
DID HE NOT SHOW YOU

1007
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,149
他手腕上刚刚愈合的伤疤吗？
A RECENTLY-HEALED SCAR ON HIS WRIST

1008
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,318
并告诉你他在用刀切面包时
AND TELL YOU THAT HE'D CUT HIMSELF

1009
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,054
割伤了自己吗？
WHILE SLICING BREAD WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE?

1010
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,989
是的，先生，他是这么说的。
YES, SIR, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.

1011
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,891
他的妻子没有告诉过你同样的事情吗？
DID HIS WIFE NOT TELL YOU THE SAME?

1012
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,359
是的，先生，但是之后——
YES, SIR, BUT AFTERWARDS--

1013
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,595
她告诉我们——不，只是——回答是或否，
SHE TOLD US-- NO, JUST-- JUST YES OR NO,

1014
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:53,030
请回答。
IF YOU PLEASE.

1015
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:55,632
他的妻子有没有告诉你
DID HIS WIFE TELL YOU HE'D CUT HIMSELF

1016
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,666
他切面包时割伤了自己？
WHILE SLICING BREAD?

1017
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,970
是的，先生。
YES, SIR.

1018
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,639
我请你检查一下这把刀。
I'LL ASK YOU TO EXAMINE THIS KNIFE.

1019
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,277
（观众议论纷纷）
( spectators chattering )

1020
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,013
请您测试一下边缘好吗
WILL YOU PLEASE TEST THE EDGE

1021
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,381
用你的手指？
WITH YOUR FINGER?

1022
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,650
好吧，现在，小心，现在，小心。
WELL, NOW, CAREFULLY, NOW, CAREFULLY.

1023
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,886
你同意
DO YOU AGREE

1024
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:18,121
那把刀锋利吗？
THAT THAT KNIFE IS RAZOR-SHARP?

1025
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,389
是的，先生。
YES, SIR.

1026
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,658
这种刀可能会造成割伤
SUCH A KNIFE COULD INFLICT A CUT

1027
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,860
会大量流血。
WHICH WOULD BLEED PROFUSELY.

1028
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,729
可能吧，先生。然后。
IT MIGHT, SIR. NOW, THEN.

1029
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,398
你说出了囚犯夹克上的血迹
YOU STATED THE BLOOD ON THE PRISONER'S JACKET

1030
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,667
还有弗伦奇夫人的血。
AND THE BLOOD OF MRS. FRENCH

1031
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,470
是同一类型——“O”。
ARE THE SAME TYPE--"O."

1032
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,038
没错。
CORRECT.

1033
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,740
如果囚犯的血
AND IF THE PRISONER'S BLOOD

1034
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,942
是同一血型，“O”型
SHOULD BE OF THE SAME TYPE, "O,"

1035
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,944
而他夹克上的血迹
THEN THE STAINS ON HIS JACKET

1036
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,512
可能恰好源自这把
MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE RESULTED

1037
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,181
刀子。
FROM THE KNIFE.

1038
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,585
你分析过囚犯的血液吗？
DID YOU ANALYZE THE PRISONER'S BLOOD?

1039
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,353
不，先生。
NO, SIR.

1040
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,355
我有证明，
I HAVE A CERTIFICATE,

1041
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:54,658
来自北伦敦医院。
NORTH LONDON HOSPITAL.

1042
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:02,065
伦纳德·沃尔 (LEONARD VOLE) 的血型被证明是...“O”型。
LEONARD VOLE IS CERTIFIED TO BE TYPE..."O."

1043
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,668
（低声说话，喋喋不休）
( murmuring, chattering )

1044
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,241
法警：传珍妮特·麦肯齐！
Usher: CALL JANET MacKENZIE!

1045
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,612
（闹钟响起）
( alarm ringing )

1046
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:22,285
（铃声停止）（叹气）
( ringing stops ) ( sighs )

1047
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,354
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

1048
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:28,125
右手拿着这个，
TAKE THIS IN YOUR RIGHT HAND,

1049
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,260
并大声读出这张卡上的内容。普利姆索尔小姐：嘘！
AND READ ALOUD WHAT'S ON THIS CARD. Miss Plimsoll: PSST!

1050
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,595
嘘！卡特！
PSST! CARTER!

1051
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:34,931
麦肯齐小姐：“我向全能的上帝发誓
Miss MacKenzie: "I SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD

1052
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,900
“我将要提供给法庭
"THAT THE EVIDENCE I SHALL GIVE

1053
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,802
“给本法庭的证据
"TO THIS COURT

1054
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,171
“是真实的，全部真实，
"SHALL BE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,

1055
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,406
除了真相，什么也没有。”
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH."

1056
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:45,242
法警：谢谢您，女士。
Usher: THANK YOU, MADAM.

1057
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,886
迈尔斯：你叫珍妮特·麦肯齐吗？
Myers: IS YOUR NAME JANET MacKENZIE?

1058
00:45:55,952 --> 00:45:57,120
是的。
YES.

1059
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,355
您是已故的艾米丽·弗伦奇夫人
WERE YOU COMPANION-HOUSEKEEPER

1060
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,957
的同伴管家吗
TO THE LATE MRS. EMILY FRENCH?

1061
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,759
我认为没有他每小时的药物
I DON'T THINK HE COULD GET THROUGH THE TRIAL

1062
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,194
他无法撑不过这场审判
WITHOUT HIS MEDICINE EVERY HOUR.

1063
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,562
我是她的管家。
I WAS HER HOUSEKEEPER.

1064
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,199
我对所谓的“同伴”没有意见。
I'VE NO OPINION OF SO-CALLED "COMPANIONS."

1065
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,500
可怜无能的身体，
POOR FECKLESS BODIES,

1066
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,402
不敢做一点诚实的工作。
AFRAID TO DO A BIT OF HONEST WORK.

1067
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,272
但你很了解她吗？
BUT YOU DID KNOW HER VERY WELL?

1068
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:16,907
十年了。
TEN YEARS.

1069
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:18,742
她信任我。
SHE TRUSTED ME.

1070
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,144
很多时候我都阻止了她
AND MANY'S THE TIME I'VE PREVENTED HER

1071
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,879
避免做傻事。
FROM DOING A FOOLISH THING.

1072
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,014
您能告诉我们吗？
WILL YOU TELL US,

1073
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,348
用你自己的话，
IN YOUR OWN WORDS,

1074
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,450
9 月 14 日晚上
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE EVENING

1075
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:29,352
发生了什么？
OF SEPTEMBER THE 14th?

1076
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,354
那是一个星期五。
IT WAS A FRIDAY.

1077
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,156
也是我出门的时间。
AND MY NIGHT OUT.

1078
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,426
我去看我的侄女——
AND I WENT OFF TO SEE MY NIECE--

1079
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,894
步行五分钟。
A FIVE MINUTE WALK.

1080
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,230
我答应过拿一个图样给她——
I'D PROMISED TO TAKE HER THE PATTERN--

1081
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,499
一个纸样——
A PAPER PATTERN--

1082
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,167
我在那里呆了一段时间
AND I'D BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE

1083
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,002
有多长时间我忘记了。
WHEREIN I REMEMBERED I FORGOT IT.

1084
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,172
后来，我走回了家
SO, I WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE

1085
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,607
在雨中。
IN THE RAIN.

1086
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:54,344
客厅里正在放着留声机。
THE PHONOGRAPH WAS PLAYING IN THE SITTING ROOM.

1087
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,681
弗伦奇太太在笑。
MRS. FRENCH WAS LAUGHING.

1088
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,350
她和他在一起。
SHE WAS IN THERE WITH HIM.

1089
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,952
不！那不是真的！
NO! THAT ISN'T TRUE!

1090
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:03,420
我听到了。
I HEARD THEM.

1091
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:06,022
你确定吗
ARE YOU QUITE CERTAIN

1092
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,357
你听到了先生的声音。沃尔？
YOU HEARD MR. VOLE?

1093
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,393
是的，他经常去看她。
AYE, HE VISITED HER OFTEN ENOUGH.

1094
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,162
所以，我去了我的房间
SO, I WENT UP TO MY ROOM

1095
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,496
我取出了图案，
AND I FETCHED THE PATTERN,

1096
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,398
然后我听到了这个声音——
AND THEN I HEARD THIS NOISE--

1097
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,733
破碎的玻璃，
CRASHING GLASS,

1098
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,236
然后是一声重击，然后是另一声重击。
AND A THUMP, AND THEN ANOTHER THUMP.

1099
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:20,704
还有——你做了什么？
AND--AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

1100
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,272
我吓坏了。
I WAS FRIGHTENED.

1101
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,242
于是，我跑到客厅，
SO, I RAN DOWN TO THE SITTING ROOM,

1102
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,310
她死在那里
AND THERE SHE WAS DEAD

1103
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,347
东西扔的到处都是。
AND EVERYTHING TOSSED HITHER AND YON.

1104
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,748
你真的认为
DID YOU REALLY THINK

1105
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,417
发生了入室盗窃案？
A BURGLARY HAD TAKEN PLACE?

1106
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,518
哦，大人。我必须抗议。
OH, MY LORD. I MUST PROTEST.

1107
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:36,953
法官：完全正确。
Judge: QUITE RIGHT.

1108
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,289
我不允许回答这个问题，
I WILL NOT ALLOW THAT QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED,

1109
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,957
迈尔斯先生。
MR. MYERS.

1110
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,995
您对囚犯了解多少？
HOW MUCH DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PRISONER?

1111
00:47:45,061 --> 00:47:46,863
我知道他需要钱。
I KNEW HE NEEDED MONEY.

1112
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,331
他从来没有向她要求过。
NOT THAT HE'D EVER ASKED HER FOR IT.

1113
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,666
他太聪明了，不会这么做。
HE WAS TOO CLEVER FOR THAT.

1114
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,768
你知道他是已婚男人吗？
WERE YOU AWARE THAT HE WAS A MARRIED MAN?

1115
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,104
不！不，确实如此。我们不知道。
NO! NO, INDEED. WE WERE NOT.

1116
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,272
珍妮特！我的上帝。
JANET! MY LORD.

1117
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:56,439
我必须抗议。
I MUST PROTEST.

1118
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,907
就证人而言，
WHAT MRS. FRENCH KNEW

1119
00:47:57,974 --> 00:47:59,409
弗伦奇夫人是否知道
OR DID NOT KNOW

1120
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,511
一定只是
MUST BE PURE CONJECTURE

1121
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,980
纯粹的猜想
ON THE PART OF THE WITNESS.

1122
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,349
我这样说吧——
I WILL PUT IT THIS WAY--

1123
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,517
（ 清嗓子 ）
( clears throat )

1124
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,486
你对他的印象
YOU FORMED THE IMPRESSION

1125
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:12,155
是一个单身汉。为什么？
HE WAS A SINGLE MAN. WHY?

1126
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,458
嗯……她订购的书——
WELL...THE BOOKS SHE ORDERED--

1127
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,761
是关于女人
ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAD MARRIED MEN

1128
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:20,297
嫁给比自己年轻几岁男人
YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEMSELVES

1129
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:23,400
关于迪斯雷利和他的妻子。
ABOUT DISRAELI AND-- AND HIS WIFE.

1130
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:25,302
我知道她在想什么。
I KNEW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING.

1131
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:27,937
恐怕我们不能承认这一点。
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ADMIT THAT.

1132
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:28,938
为什么？
WHY?

1133
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:30,140
评审团成员，
MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

1134
00:48:30,206 --> 00:48:31,508
对于女性来说这是完全可能的
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN

1135
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,243
阅读迪斯雷利
TO READ DISRAELI

1136
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,011
而不考虑嫁给
WITHOUT CONTEMPLATING MARRIAGE

1137
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,279
给一个年轻男子。
TO A YOUNGER MAN.

1138
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,581
（咯咯笑，低语）
( chuckling, murmuring )

1139
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:41,217
关于她的遗嘱——
CONCERNING HER WILL--

1140
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:42,519
她把它撤销了——
SHE HAD IT REVOKED--

1141
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,754
旧的那个——
THE OLD ONE--

1142
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,756
而且，呃，起草了新的。
AND, UH, A NEW ONE DRAWN UP.

1143
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,958
我听到她打电话给她的律师，
I HEARD HER TELEPHONING HER SOLICITOR,

1144
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,361
同他一起——他当时也在场。
AND SO DID HE-- HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

1145
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,097
你确实听到了弗伦奇夫人
YOU ACTUALLY HEARD MRS. FRENCH

1146
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,266
和被告一起
DISCUSSING HER NEW WILL

1147
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,634
讨论她的新遗嘱？
WITH HIM?

1148
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,503
是的。他将拥有她所有的钱。
YES. HE WAS TO HAVE ALL OF HER MONEY.

1149
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,439
没有其他人受益，他就是这么干的。
NO ONE ELSE MEANT TO HAVE WHAT HE DID.

1150
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,407
这是什么时候发生的？
WHEN DID THIS TAKE PLACE?

1151
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,009
9 月 8 日。
SEPTEMBER THE 8th.

1152
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,211
距离她被谋杀一周之前。
IT WAS A WEEK TO THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS MURDERED.

1153
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,979
谢谢。
THANK YOU.

1154
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:12,482
我的询问到此结束。
THAT CONCLUDES MY EXAMINATION.

1155
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,150
（观众窃窃私语）
( spectators murmuring )

1156
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,024
威尔弗雷德爵士：还没有……
Sir Wilfred: NOT JUST YET...

1157
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,992
麦肯齐小姐。
MISS MacKENZIE.

1158
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,335
您已经向我们提供了有关两份遗嘱的证词。
YOU'VE GIVEN US TESTIMONY ABOUT TWO WILLS.

1159
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,237
在旧的遗嘱里，
IN THE OLD ONE,

1160
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,373
谁将会获得
WHO WAS TO RECEIVE THE BULK

1161
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:38,441
弗伦奇夫人的家产？
OF MRS. FRENCH'S ESTATE?

1162
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,110
是我。
I WAS.

1163
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:41,311
而在新的遗嘱里——
AND IN THE NEW ONE--

1164
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,446
只给了你一小笔年金，
ONLY A SMALL ANNUITY FOR YOU,

1165
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,415
其余的属于犯人
AND THE REST TO THE PRISONER,

1166
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,217
伦纳德·沃尔。
LEONARD VOLE.

1167
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:48,785
这是邪恶的不公！
A WICKED INJUSTICE

1168
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,553
如果他动过那笔钱的一分
IF HE EVER TOUCHES A PENNY OF THAT MONEY.

1169
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,255
我很能理解
I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND

1170
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,823
如果你觉得...
IF YOU FEEL...

1171
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,426
与囚犯有敌意
ANTAGONISTIC TO THE PRISONER.

1172
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,829
我？ 敌-敌意？
ME? A-ANTAGONISTIC?

1173
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,966
他是个懒惰的、诡计多端的流氓，
HE'S A SHIFTLESS, SCHEMING RASCAL,

1174
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:06,736
但我对他毫无敌意。 （笑声）
BUT I AM NOT ANTAGONISTIC TO HIM. ( laughter )

1175
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,338
他与你情妇的友谊
HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH YOUR MISTRESS

1176
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,408
让你损失了她的大部分财产。
COST YOU THE BULK OF HER ESTATE.

1177
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,910
我从来不喜欢他。
I NEVER LIKED HIM.

1178
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,146
你的坦率最令人耳目一新。
YOUR CANDOR IS MOST REFRESHING.

1179
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:18,114
（观众笑）
( spectators laugh )

1180
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,849
你说你9 月 14 日晚上
YOU SAY YOU HEARD THEM

1181
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,885
听到他们谈话。
ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THE 14th.

1182
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:24,087
你听到他们说什么？
WHAT DID YOU HEAR THEM SAY?

1183
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,157
他们在笑。
THEY WERE LAUGHING.

1184
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:28,491
囚犯说了什么？
WHAT DID THE PRISONER SAY?

1185
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,859
只是笑。
JUST LAUGHING.

1186
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,528
您对此非常确定，是吗？
QUITE SURE ABOUT THAT, ARE YOU?

1187
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:33,997
是的。门关着。
AYE. THE DOOR WAS CLOSED.

1188
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:36,332
打开——打开了一条小裂缝。
OPEN--IT WAS OPEN A WEE CRACK.

1189
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,301
你很快走过门口吗？
DID YOU PASS THE DOOR QUICKLY?

1190
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,770
好吧，时间足够长——能听到。
WELL, LONG ENOUGH TO--TO HEAR.

1191
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,272
哦，好吧好吧，麦肯齐小姐。
OH, COME, COME, MISS MacKENZIE.

1192
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:45,141
我确定你不想向陪审团建议
I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST TO THE JURY

1193
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,776
你是个偷听者。
THAT YOU WERE AN EAVESDROPPER.

1194
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,212
就是他。我知道的！
IT WAS HIM. I KNOW IT!

1195
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,547
嗯，你看到他了吗？
WELL, DID YOU SEE HIM?

1196
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:52,549
你真的看到他了吗？
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE HIM?

1197
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:54,317
呃——她。
UH--HER.

1198
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,286
什么？
WHAT?

1199
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:58,788
我可以看到她，
I COULD SEE HER,

1200
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,290
但我知道他就在那里。
BUT I KNEW HE WAS THERE.

1201
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,392
为什么？因为你听到了他的声音？
WHY? BECAUSE YOU HEARD HIM?

1202
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,160
是的。
YES.

1203
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,964
根据国民健康保险，麦肯齐小姐，
UNDER THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE, MISS MacKENZIE,

1204
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:11,334
您申请了吗...
DID YOU APPLY...

1205
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,237
（轻声）要配助听器吗？
( quietly ) FOR A HEARING AID?

1206
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,605
什么？
A WHAT?

1207
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:19,008
（小声地说）要配助听器吗？
( speaking quietly ) FOR A HEARING AID?

1208
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,278
你说什么？
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1209
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,013
法官大人，我必须反对
MY LORD, I MUST OBJECT

1210
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,349
这个问题的提出方式。
TO THE WAY THIS QUESTION IS BEING PUT.

1211
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,817
我重复这个问题...
I'LL REPEAT...

1212
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,686
法官大人。
THE QUESTION, MY LORD.

1213
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:32,422
我问过你 -
I ASKED YOU--

1214
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,957
用正常的语调，
IN A NORMAL TONE OF VOICE,

1215
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:35,959
好让法庭可以听到——
AUDIBLE TO THE OPEN COURT--

1216
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:39,362
您是否向国民保险
DID YOU APPLY TO THE NATIONAL INSURANCE

1217
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,864
申请过助听器吗？
FOR A HEARING AID?

1218
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,931
麦肯齐小姐：是的，我申请了。
Miss MacKenzie: YES, I DID.

1219
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,534
你收到了吗？还没有。
DID YOU GET IT? NOT YET.

1220
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,769
但你却说
AND YET YOU STATE

1221
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:50,006
你能听到囚犯的声音......
THAT YOU COULD HEAR THE PRISONER'S VOICE...

1222
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,209
（轻声地）在外面的房间里？
( quietly ) IN A ROOM BEYOND?

1223
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,345
什么？
WHAT?

1224
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:56,813
（低声）
( murmuring )

1225
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,915
没有更多的问题了，大人。
NO MORE QUESTIONS, MY LORD.

1226
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,050
（嘀咕声继续）
( murmuring continues )

1227
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,755
法官大人，也许您可​​以帮助我。
PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP ME, YOUR LORDSHIP.

1228
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,323
六个多月前
I APPLIED FOR THE HEARING AID

1229
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,058
我申请了助听器。
OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.

1230
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,493
还有——我亲爱的麦肯齐小姐，
AND-- MY DEAR MISS MacKENZIE,

1231
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,428
考虑这些天人们讨论的
CONSIDERING THE RUBBISH

1232
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:14,464
都是些废话，
BEING TALKED ABOUT THESE DAYS,

1233
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,566
您什么都没有错过。
YOU HAVE NOT MISSED ANYTHING.

1234
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,168
（观众笑）
( spectators laughing )

1235
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,085
好了，我们开始吧。
OVER WE GO.

1236
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:40,790
现在，大人请允许我
AND NOW, IF IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,

1237
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,760
传唤检方的
I SHOULD LIKE TO CALL UPON OUR FINAL WITNESS

1238
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:45,428
最后一位证人。
FOR THE PROSECUTION.

1239
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,096
传克里斯汀·赫尔姆。
CALL CHRISTINE HELM.

1240
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:50,466
（低声）克里斯汀？
( whispering ) CHRISTINE?

1241
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:52,569
法警：传克里斯汀·赫尔姆！
Usher: CALL CHRISTINE HELM!

1242
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:56,105
传克里斯汀·赫尔姆！
CALL CHRISTINE HELM!

1243
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,714
（评论含糊不清）
( comments indistinctly )

1244
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,753
法警：这边走，女士。
Usher: THIS WAY, MADAM.

1245
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,396
女士，请脱掉您的手套。
PLEASE REMOVE YOUR GLOVE, MADAM.

1246
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,599
右手拿着这个，
TAKE THIS IN YOUR RIGHT HAND,

1247
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,867
并大声读出这张卡片上写的内容。
AND READ ALOUD WHAT'S WRITTEN ON THIS CARD.

1248
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:28,004
“我向全能的上帝发誓
"I SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD

1249
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:30,273
“我要提供的证据
"THAT THE EVIDENCE WHICH I SHALL GIVE

1250
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,141
“将是真相，全部真相，
"SHALL BE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,

1251
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,510
除了真相，什么也没有。”
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH."

1252
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,212
谢谢夫人。
THANK YOU, MADAM.

1253
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:42,151
大人，我早该想到的
MY LORD, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT

1254
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,853
这太明显了
ONLY TOO OBVIOUS

1255
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,321
我要向本法院指出
TO POINT OUT TO THIS COURT

1256
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,591
控方传唤的证人
THAT THE WITNESS SUMMONED HERE BY THE PROSECUTION

1257
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,361
是囚犯伦纳德·沃尔，
IS THE WIFE OF THE PRISONER,

1258
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,562
的妻子，
LEONARD VOLE,

1259
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,063
因此——法官大人。
AND THEREFORE-- MY LORD.

1260
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,932
我必须提醒我博学的朋友的注意
I MUST CALL MY LEARNED FRIEND'S ATTENTION

1261
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,468
事实上，呃，我传唤了，呃，
TO THE FACT THAT, UH, I SUMMONED, UH,

1262
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,570
克里斯汀，呃，赫尔姆，
CHRISTINE, UH, HELM,

1263
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,106
不是克里斯汀·沃尔。
NOT CHRISTINE VOLE.

1264
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:04,607
事实上，你的名字是克里斯汀·赫尔姆？
YOUR NAME IS, IN FACT, CHRISTINE HELM?

1265
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,808
是的。
YES.

1266
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,043
克里斯汀·赫尔姆。
CHRISTINE HELM.

1267
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,411
而你一直以囚犯伦纳德·沃尔
AND YOU'VE BEEN LIVING AS THE WIFE

1268
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,147
妻子的身份生活？是的。
OF THE PRISONER, LEONARD VOLE? YES.

1269
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,082
你真的是他的妻子吗？不。
ARE YOU ACTUALLY HIS WIFE? NO.

1270
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,853
我们在汉堡经历了某种形式的婚姻，
WE WENT THROUGH A FORM OF MARRIAGE IN HAMBURG,

1271
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:19,088
但我已经有丈夫了
BUT I ALREADY HAD A HUSBAND

1272
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,591
住在东德的某个地方。
LIVING SOMEWHERE IN EAST GERMANY.

1273
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,559
他现在还活着。
HE IS STILL LIVING TODAY.

1274
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,128
迈尔斯：但你从未告诉过沃尔先生？
Myers: BUT YOU NEVER TOLD MR. VOLE?

1275
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:28,097
如果告诉他那就太愚蠢了。
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STUPID TO TELL HIM.

1276
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,565
他不会娶我，
HE WOULD NOT HAVE MARRIED ME,

1277
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:31,901
而我会被饿死
AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO STARVE

1278
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,403
死在战争废墟里。谢谢。
OVER THERE IN THE RUBBLE. THANK YOU.

1279
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:34,837
威尔弗雷德爵士：法官大人。
Sir Wilfred: MY LORD.

1280
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,205
证人与伦纳德·沃尔之间
THERE IS PROOF OF A MARRIAGE

1281
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,541
有婚姻证明。
BETWEEN THE WITNESS AND LEONARD VOLE.

1282
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,943
但没有任何证据证明
THERE'S NO PROOF WHATSOEVER

1283
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,279
之前所谓的婚姻。
OF AN ALLEGED PREVIOUS MARRIAGE.

1284
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,948
但之前的所谓婚姻
BUT THE ALLEGED PREVIOUS MARRIAGE

1285
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,117
文档非常齐全。
IS EXTREMELY WELL-DOCUMENTED.

1286
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,954
我有证书。
I HAVE A CERTIFICATE.

1287
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:54,590
（低声）赫尔姆夫人，
( murmuring ) MRS. HELM,

1288
00:54:54,657 --> 00:54:56,325
这是关于你与
IS THIS THE CERTIFICATE

1289
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,027
一位叫奥托·路德维希·赫尔姆
OF YOUR MARRIAGE

1290
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,963
的人结婚的证明吗？
TO ONE OTTO LUDWIG HELM?

1291
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,833
1942 年 4 月 18 日
THE CEREMONY HAVING TAKEN PLACE

1292
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,001
结婚仪式在布雷斯劳
IN BRESLAU

1293
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,071
曾经举行过？
ON APRIL THE 18th, 1942?

1294
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,105
是的。
YES.

1295
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,040
这是我的结婚证。
THIS IS THE PAPER OF MY MARRIAGE.

1296
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,142
法官：我想看一下那份证明。
Judge: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CERTIFICATE.

1297
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:20,083
听取了威尔弗雷德爵士的意见后，
HAVING HAD THE BENEFIT OF SIR WILFRED'S OPINION,

1298
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,517
您可以继续了，迈尔斯先生。
YOU MAY PROCEED, MR. MYERS.

1299
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,352
谢谢您，大人。
THANK YOU, MY LORD.

1300
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,089
赫尔姆夫人，
MRS. HELM,

1301
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,491
你愿意针对这位
ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE TESTIMONY

1302
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,992
你曾经称他为丈夫
AGAINST THE MAN

1303
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,494
的男人作证吗？
YOU HAVE BEEN CALLING YOUR HUSBAND?

1304
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,830
我愿意。
I AM WILLING.

1305
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:35,798
在你对警方陈述
IN THE--THE NIGHT IN QUESTION,

1306
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,600
的那个晚上，
YOU STATED TO THE POLICE

1307
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,802
那，呃，你的丈夫
THAT, UH, YOUR HUSBAND

1308
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,238
9点30分之前回到家。
RETURNED HOME BEFORE 9:30.

1309
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,307
事实上，他在 9:30 之前就回家了吗？
DID HE, IN FACT, RETURN HOME BEFORE 9:30?

1310
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,008
不。
NO.

1311
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,010
他于 10:00 过 10 分钟回来。
HE RETURNED AT TEN MINUTES PAST 10:00.

1312
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:49,946
克里斯汀！你在说什么？
CHRISTINE! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1313
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:51,614
这不是真的！你知道这不是真的！
THAT'S NOT TRUE! YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE!

1314
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,282
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

1315
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,951
法官：正如你的律师会告诉你的那样，沃尔，
Judge: AS YOUR COUNSEL WILL TELL YOU, VOLE,

1316
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:56,352
您很快就会有机会
YOU WILL VERY SHORTLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

1317
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,354
为自己辩护。
OF SPEAKING IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE.

1318
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,622
迈尔斯：现在，然后。
Myers: NOW, THEN.

1319
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,558
沃尔 于十点过十分回到家。
MR. VOLE RETURNED AT TEN MINUTES PAST 10:00.

1320
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,559
接下来发生了什么？
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

1321
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,395
他呼吸困难。
HE WAS BREATHING HARD.

1322
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:07,396
很兴奋。
VERY EXCITED.

1323
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:10,032
他脱掉了外套
HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT

1324
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:11,968
并看着他的袖子。
AND LOOKED AT HIS SLEEVES.

1325
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,402
袖子上有血。
THEY HAD BLOOD ON THEM.

1326
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:15,438
继续。
GO ON. I SAID,

1327
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,873
我说，“发生了什么事？”
"WHAT HAS HAPPENED?"

1328
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:18,274
囚犯对此说了什么？
AND WHAT DID THE PRISONER SAY TO THAT?

1329
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,876
他说，
HE SAID,

1330
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:21,444
“我杀了她。”
"I HAVE KILLED HER."

1331
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,012
克里斯汀！
CHRISTINE!

1332
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,347
你为什么说这些话？！
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THESE THINGS?!

1333
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:25,281
你为什么撒谎？！
WHY ARE YOU LYING?!

1334
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,549
安静！
SILENCE!

1335
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,119
（低声说话，喋喋不休）
( murmuring, chattering )

1336
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,590
哦，她可真恐怖！
OOH, SHE'S AWFUL, THAT ONE!

1337
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,992
我一直都知道。
I'VE KNOWN IT ALL ALONG.

1338
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,094
威尔弗雷德爵士，
SIR WILFRED,

1339
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,328
你需要我
WOULD YOU LIKE ME

1340
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,630
安排休庭几分钟吗？
TO ADJOURN FOR A FEW MINUTES?

1341
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:42,365
最仁慈的法官大人。
MY LORDSHIP IS MOST GRACIOUS.

1342
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:45,968
但请让证人继续。
BUT PRAY, LET THE WITNESS CONTINUE.

1343
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,904
我们都陷入这部
WE'RE ALL SO CAUGHT UP

1344
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,406
恐怖小说的悬念当中
IN THE SUSPENSE OF THIS HORRID FICTION.

1345
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,975
必须一点一点听明白
TO HAVE TO HEAR IT IN INSTALLMENTS

1346
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,077
可能让人难以忍受。
MIGHT PROVE UNENDURABLE.

1347
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:57,914
请继续，迈尔斯先生。
PROCEED, MR. MYERS.

1348
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,048
迈尔斯：谢谢您，大人。
Myers: THANK YOU, MY LORD.

1349
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,583
赫尔姆夫人，呃，你曾告诉警察
MRS. HELM, UH, IS IT TRUE

1350
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,120
犯人在9:30 之前已经回家
THAT YOU TOLD THE POLICE

1351
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,155
是真的吗？
THAT THE PRISONER RETURNED HOME BEFORE 9:30?

1352
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:10,092
是的，因为伦纳德想让我那么说。
YES, BECAUSE LEONARD WANTED ME TO SAY THAT.

1353
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,429
但之后你改变了言辞，为什么？
BUT YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR STORY SINCE THEN. WHY?

1354
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,301
我不能继续撒谎来救他。
I CANNOT GO ON LYING TO SAVE HIM.

1355
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,169
他娶了我，
HE MARRIED ME,

1356
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,271
我很感激他
AND I WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM

1357
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,906
带我离开德国。
FOR GETTING ME OUT OF GERMANY.

1358
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,608
一直很感激。
ALWAYS.

1359
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,943
他要我做的
WHAT HE HAS ASKED ME TO DO

1360
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,878
我都做了，
I HAVE DONE,

1361
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,880
因为我很感激他。
BECAUSE I WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM.

1362
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,115
但不是因为你爱他？
BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU LOVED HIM?

1363
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:36,652
不。我从来没有爱过他。
NO. I NEVER LOVED HIM.

1364
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,621
所以这是因为
SO IT IS OUT OF GRATITUDE

1365
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,056
出于对犯人的感激
TO THE PRISONER

1366
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:41,357
在您给警方的陈述中
THAT YOU GAVE HIM AN ALIBI

1367
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,092
你才给他提供了不在场证明？
IN YOUR STATEMENT TO THE POLICE?

1368
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,362
是的。现在你觉得你这样做是错误的吗？
YES. NOW YOU FEEL YOU WERE WRONG TO DO SO?

1369
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,130
这是谋杀。
IT IS MURDER.

1370
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:52,068
那个女人是个无害的老傻瓜，
THAT WOMAN WAS A HARMLESS OLD FOOL,

1371
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:56,472
但我不能成为他谋杀的同谋。
BUT I CANNOT BE AN ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER FOR HIM.

1372
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,841
我做不到。
I CANNOT DO IT.

1373
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,010
我不会这么做。
I WILL NOT DO IT.

1374
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,145
这就是事实吗？
SO THIS IS THE TRUTH?

1375
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,014
十点后他回到家
HE RETURNED HOME AFTER 10:00

1376
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,382
他的袖子上沾满了血，
WITH BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES,

1377
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,084
说：“我杀了她。”
SAYING, "I KILLED HER."

1378
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,986
这是事实。
THAT IS THE TRUTH.

1379
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:11,320
这是事实 -
THAT IS THE TRUTH--

1380
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:12,455
在上帝面前？
BEFORE GOD?

1381
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:14,423
这是事实 -
THAT IS THE TRUTH--

1382
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,391
在上帝面前。
BEFORE GOD.

1383
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,127
谢谢。
THANK YOU.

1384
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,668
沃尔夫人。
MRS. VOLE.

1385
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,437
或赫尔姆夫人。
OR MRS. HELM.

1386
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:31,507
您更喜欢被称为哪个？
WHICH DO YOU PREFER TO BE CALLED?

1387
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,175
那不重要。
IT DOES NOT MATTER.

1388
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:35,444
哦，不是吗？
OH, DOES IT NOT?

1389
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:38,281
在这个国家，我们对婚姻倾向于
IN THIS COUNTRY, WE ARE INCLINED TO TAKE

1390
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:40,850
采取更严肃的看法。
A RATHER MORE SERIOUS VIEW OF MARRIAGE.

1391
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,586
然而，赫尔姆女士，
HOWEVER, FRAU HELM,

1392
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:47,290
看起来当你第一次见到囚犯时，
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WHEN YOU FIRST MET THE PRISONER,

1393
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:50,893
您在婚姻状况方面对他撒了谎。
YOU LIED TO HIM ABOUT YOUR MARITAL STATUS.

1394
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,629
我非常想离开德国。
I WAS DESPERATE TO GET OUT OF GERMANY.

1395
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,697
你撒谎了，不是吗？
YOU LIED, DID YOU NOT?

1396
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,166
只是——请说是或否。
JUST--YES OR NO, PLEASE.

1397
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,834
是的。谢谢。
YES. THANK YOU.

1398
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:00,369
然后接下来，
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY,

1399
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,338
当您安排婚姻时，
WHEN YOU WERE ARRANGING THE MARRIAGE,

1400
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,840
你对当局撒了谎吗？
YOU LIED TO THE AUTHORITIES?

1401
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,242
我没有告诉他们真相，因为——
I DID NOT TELL THEM THE TRUTH BECAUSE--

1402
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,576
你对他们撒谎了吗？
YOU LIED TO THEM?

1403
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:08,911
是的。
YES.

1404
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,846
在结婚典礼本身中，
IN THE CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE ITSELF,

1405
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:12,214
当你为爱与荣耀
WHEN YOU SWORE

1406
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:15,351
发誓要珍视
TO LOVE AND TO HONOR

1407
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,887
你的丈夫时，
AND TO CHERISH YOUR HUSBAND,

1408
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,890
这也是谎言吗？
THAT, TOO, WAS A LIE?

1409
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,792
是的。
YES.

1410
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:24,794
然后，当警察问到
AND THEN, WHEN THE POLICE

1411
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,195
这个可怜的
ABOUT THIS WRETCHED MAN

1412
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,332
相信自己已经结婚相爱的男人——
WHO BELIEVED HIMSELF MARRIED AND LOVED--

1413
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:31,167
（猛吸一口气）你告诉他们——
( inhales sharply ) YOU TOLD THEM--

1414
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:33,936
我告诉他们伦纳德想让我说的话。
I TOLD THEM WHAT LEONARD WANTED ME TO SAY.

1415
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,304
你告诉他们
YOU TOLD THEM

1416
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,940
他在 9 点 30 分之前就到家了，
THAT HE WAS AT HOME WITH YOU BY 9:30,

1417
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,676
现在你说那是谎言。
AND NOW YOU SAY THAT WAS A LIE.

1418
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,812
是的。一个谎言。
YES. A LIE.

1419
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:44,480
当时你说
AND WHEN YOU HAD SAID

1420
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,449
他不小心割伤了手腕，
HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY CUT HIS WRIST,

1421
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:48,250
你也是在撒谎。
AGAIN YOU LIED.

1422
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,553
是的。现在，今天，
YES. AND NOW, TODAY,

1423
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:54,357
你给我们讲述了一个全新的故事。
YOU'VE TOLD US A NEW STORY ENTIRELY.

1424
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:56,959
问题是，赫尔姆女士，
THE QUESTION IS, FRAU HELM,

1425
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,828
你当时撒谎呢，
WERE YOU LYING THEN,

1426
00:59:58,894 --> 01:00:01,163
还是现在撒谎，
OR ARE YOU LYING NOW,

1427
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:06,335
或者根本上，你就是个反复无常的骗子？（译注：缺失部分英语字幕）
OR ARE YOU NOT, IN FACT, CHRONIC AND HER BEAT YOU A LIAR

1428
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,170
（观众低声议论）
( spectators murmur )

1429
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,538
（呼吸粗重）
( breathes heavily )

1430
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:14,510
（低声）再吃一颗！
( whispering ) THE OTHER PILL!

1431
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:15,644
放在舌头下面。
UNDER THE TONGUE.

1432
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:17,380
迈尔斯：大人，您允许我博学的朋友
Myers: MY LORD, IS MY LEARNED FRIEND

1433
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:19,148
用这样的态度
TO BE ALLOWED TO BULLY AND INSULT

1434
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,183
冒犯和恐吓证人吗？
THIS WITNESS IN THIS MANNER?

1435
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,419
法官：迈尔斯先生，这是死刑指控，
Judge: MR. MYERS, THIS IS A CAPITAL CHARGE,

1436
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,388
在合理范围内，
AND WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REASON,

1437
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,656
我希望能够尽可能自由的辩护。
I WOULD LIKE THE DEFENSE TO HAVE EVERY LATITUDE.

1438
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:29,358
的确。
INDEED.

1439
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,659
证人违反了很多誓言
THE WITNESS HAS VIOLATED SO MANY OATHS

1440
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,762
我很惊讶
THAT I AM SURPRISED THE TESTAMENT

1441
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:34,230
她今天在这里宣誓过
DID NOT LEAP FROM HER HAND

1442
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,699
而证言还是围着她转圈。
WHEN SHE WAS SWORN IN HERE TODAY.

1443
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,467
我怀疑继续询问你
I DOUBT THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE GAINED

1444
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,936
还会有什么收获。
BY QUESTIONING YOU ANY FURTHER.

1445
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:42,872
就这样吧，
THAT WILL BE ALL,

1446
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:44,206
赫尔姆夫人。
FRAU HELM.

1447
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,242
赫尔姆夫人，
MRS. HELM,

1448
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,511
你知道英语单词“伪证”
DO YOU KNOW THE MEANING

1449
01:00:48,577 --> 01:00:51,514
意味着什么吗？
OF THE ENGLISH WORD "PERJURY"?

1450
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,548
是的。
YES.

1451
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,151
意味着宣誓之后又说假话。
IT MEANS TO SWEAR FALSE UNDER OATH.

1452
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,786
您是否知道在这个国家，
AND ARE YOU AWARE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY,

1453
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,220
对伪证罪的处罚
THE PENALTY FOR PERJURY

1454
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,222
是很重的监禁刑期？
IS A VERY HEAVY TERM OF IMPRISONMENT?

1455
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,957
是的，我知道。
YES, I AM AWARE.

1456
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:04,193
注意到这一点，
MINDFUL OF THIS,

1457
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,529
你还说你提供的证词
DO YOU SAY THAT THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE GIVEN

1458
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,264
是事实，都是事实，
IS THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,

1459
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,699
除了真相，什么都没有？
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

1460
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:12,835
所以请上帝帮助我。
SO HELP ME GOD.

1461
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,570
谢谢。
THANK YOU.

1462
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:18,541
法官大人，检方的询问到此结束。
THAT CONCLUDES THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION, MY LORD.

1463
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:37,359
法官：威尔弗雷德爵士，
Judge: SIR WILFRED,

1464
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:39,595
您准备好辩护了吗？
ARE YOU READY FOR THE DEFENSE?

1465
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:42,898
尊敬的法官大人，
MY LORD,

1466
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,901
尊敬的评审团成员们，
MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

1467
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,204
检方
THE PROSECUTION

1468
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,340
非常巧妙地呈现了一起诉讼，
VERY ABLY PRESENTED

1469
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,376
用最具压倒性的间接证据
AGAINST THE PRISONER, LEONARD VOLE,

1470
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:59,582
来起诉囚犯伦纳德·沃尔。
A CASE OF THE MOST OVERWHELMING CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

1471
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,718
你们听到珍妮特·麦肯齐
YOU HEARD THE EVIDENCE

1472
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,553
的证言，
OF JANET MacKENZIE,

1473
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,555
一位忠诚而尽职的管家，
A WORTHY AND DEVOTED HOUSEKEEPER,

1474
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:11,260
却遭受了两次惨痛损失——
WHO SUFFERED TWO MOST GRIEVOUS LOSSES--

1475
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,330
首先，她心爱的夫人死了，
FIRST, THE DEATH OF HER BELOVED MISTRESS,

1476
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:17,366
其次，
AND SECOND,

1477
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:21,604
被剥夺八万英镑的继承权，
BEING DEPRIVED OF AN INHERITANCE OF £80,000,

1478
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:25,441
这是她一直满心期待得到的。
WHICH SHE HAD FULLY EXPECTED TO RECEIVE.

1479
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,310
我要向她表达
MAY I EXPRESS MY SYMPATHY TO HER

1480
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,613
我对这两个不幸
ON BOTH THESE...

1481
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:31,780
的同情。
MISHAPS.

1482
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,884
最后，
AND FINALLY,

1483
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,485
最具破坏性的是，
MOST DAMAGING OF ALL,

1484
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:39,388
检方传唤了一位让人惊讶的证人，
THE PROSECUTION HAS PRODUCED A SURPRISE WITNESS,

1485
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,757
克里斯汀·赫尔姆，
ONE CHRISTINE HELM,

1486
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,359
犯人同她结婚
WHOM THE PRISONER MARRIED

1487
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:46,328
把她从废墟中带出来
AND REMOVED FROM THE RUBBLE OF HER HOMELAND

1488
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,164
来到这个安全的国家，
TO THE SAFETY OF THIS COUNTRY,

1489
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,499
给了她爱情
GIVING HER HIS LOVE

1490
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,234
以及保护她的夫姓。
AND THE PROTECTION OF HIS NAME.

1491
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,436
虽然妻子不能
THOUGH A WIFE CANNOT

1492
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:57,640
提供不利于或伤害她丈夫的证据，
GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST OR HARMFUL TO HER HUSBAND,

1493
01:02:57,706 --> 01:03:01,944
但她与他的婚姻被证明欺诈
HER MARRIAGE TO HIM HAS PROVEN FRAUDULENT

1494
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,313
而且是重婚。
AND BIGAMOUS.

1495
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,882
我请你们考虑这段婚姻
I WILL ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS MARRIAGE

1496
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,186
的存在价值。
FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH.

1497
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:14,390
那么，这些就是检方的意见。
THIS, THEN, IS THE PROSECUTION'S CASE.

1498
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:17,326
现在轮到辩护了。
IT IS NOW THE TURN FOR THE DEFENSE.

1499
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,663
我们可以提供各种证人
WE COULD PRESENT A VARIETY OF WITNESSES

1500
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:21,764
来证明他的性格，
TO HIS CHARACTER,

1501
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,066
他的战时记录，
HIS WAR RECORD,

1502
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,636
过去没有任何犯罪记录——
THE LACK OF ANY CRIMINAL ASSOCIATION IN THE PAST--

1503
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:32,975
然而，我会传唤唯一一位证人
HOWEVER, I WILL CALL UPON THE ONLY ONE WITNESS

1504
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,478
这个人能解开这个悲剧之谜——
WHO CAN SHED LIGHT UPON THIS TRAGIC RIDDLE--

1505
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:38,547
就是囚犯本人。
THE PRISONER HIMSELF.

1506
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:42,585
我请伦纳德·史蒂芬·沃尔上庭发言。
I CALL UPON LEONARD STEPHEN VOLE.

1507
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,722
（低声说话，喋喋不休）
( murmuring, chattering )

1508
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:01,203
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

1509
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,638
右手拿着这个，
TAKE THIS IN YOUR RIGHT HAND,

1510
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,507
并大声读出这张卡片上写的内容。
AND READ ALOUD WHAT'S WRITTEN ON THIS CARD.

1511
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:08,277
“我向全能的上帝发誓
"I SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD

1512
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,645
“我要提供的证据
"THAT THE EVIDENCE I SHALL GIVE

1513
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,513
“将是真相，全部真相，
"WILL BE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,

1514
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,948
除了真相，什么也没有。”
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH."

1515
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:19,655
威尔弗雷德爵士：您的名字是伦纳德·沃尔？
Sir Wilfred: YOUR NAME IS LEONARD VOLE?

1516
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:20,623
是的。
IT IS.

1517
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:22,358
你是否
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT

1518
01:04:22,424 --> 01:04:24,960
在9 月 14 日最后一天晚上
ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THE 14th LAST

1519
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,863
谋杀艾米丽·弗伦奇？
MURDER EMILY FRENCH?

1520
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,732
没有。
I DID NOT.

1521
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,802
（观众笑）
( spectators chuckle )

1522
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,543
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

1523
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,911
事实上，你是否结束了
HAVE YOU, IN FACT,

1524
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:44,747
对证人的询问，
CONCLUDED YOUR EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS,

1525
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:45,748
威尔弗雷德爵士？
SIR WILFRED?

1526
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:47,249
法官大人。
MY LORD.

1527
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,951
囚犯现在已经忍受了
THE PRISONER HAS NOW ENDURED

1528
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,289
三天最深的精神痛苦和打击。
THREE DAYS OF THE MOST PROFOUND MENTAL AGONY AND SHOCK.

1529
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:54,623
辩方认为
THE DEFENSE FEELS

1530
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,659
他多余的精力
HIS FACULTIES SHOULD BE SPARED

1531
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,661
只能用于交叉询问。
FOR THE CROSS-EXAMINATION.

1532
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,400
（低声）
( murmuring )

1533
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:05,801
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

1534
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,303
沃尔先生,
MR. VOLE,

1535
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:10,806
当你第一次认识弗伦奇夫人，
WHEN YOU FIRST MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. FRENCH,

1536
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,007
你有工作吗？
WERE YOU EMPLOYED?

1537
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,276
没有。
NO.

1538
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,279
那么，您有储蓄吗？
YOU HAD MONEY, THEN, IN SAVINGS?

1539
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,614
没有
NOTHING.

1540
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,816
你从弗伦奇夫人那里收钱了吗？
DID YOU RECEIVE ANY MONEY FROM MRS. FRENCH?

1541
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,718
不，一分钱都没有。
NO, NOT A PENNY.

1542
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:25,287
您希望收到吗？ 不，先生。
DID YOU EXPECT TO RECEIVE ANY? NO, SIR.

1543
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,256
你知道她在遗嘱里
DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAD LEFT YOU MONEY

1544
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,390
留钱给你了吗？
IN HER WILL?

1545
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,558
不，先生。
NO, SIR.

1546
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,560
当你去拜访弗伦奇夫人时
WHEN YOU WENT TO VISIT MRS. FRENCH

1547
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,295
最后一次，
FOR THE LAST TIME,

1548
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,763
你穿风衣了吗
DID YOU WEAR ATRENCH COATTRENCHCOAT

1549
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,465
还有帽子？
AND A HAT?

1550
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,267
是的，我穿了。
YES, I DID.

1551
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,636
是这件外套和帽子吗？
WAS IT THIS COAT AND HAT?

1552
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,976
是的。
YES.

1553
01:05:48,043 --> 01:05:50,312
法官大人，呃，
MY LORD, UH,

1554
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,614
辩方散发了这张画像
THE DEFENSE CIRCULATED THIS POSTER

1555
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,550
希望有证人出面
IN THE HOPE THAT A WITNESS WOULD COME FORTH

1556
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:57,019
证明曾见到被告在特定的时间
WHO HAD SEEN THE ACCUSED

1557
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,588
离开弗伦奇夫人的房子。
LEAVE MRS. FRENCH'S HOUSE AT THE TIME STATED.

1558
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,724
不幸的是，没能找到。
UNFORTUNATELY, THE EFFORT WAS WITHOUT RESULT.

1559
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,460
然而...
HOWEVER...

1560
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:08,330
辩方会很高兴听到
THE DEFENSE WILL BE PLEASED TO HEAR

1561
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,800
目击者现已出面
THAT A WITNESS HAS NOW COME FORWARD

1562
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,603
曾经看到戴这顶帽子的囚犯
WHO SAW THE PRISONER WEARING THIS HAT

1563
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,239
（笑）还有这件外套。
( chuckles ) AND THIS COAT.

1564
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,675
可惜的是，
LAMENTABLY,

1565
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:23,245
不是在谋杀当晚，
IT WAS NOT ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER,

1566
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,848
但就在一周前。
BUT EXACTLY ONE WEEK BEFORE.

1567
01:06:27,716 --> 01:06:31,286
你是否在9月8日到过
WERE YOU OR WERE YOU NOT IN A TRAVEL AGENCY

1568
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:34,623
摄政街的旅行社，
IN REGENT STREET ON THE 8th OF SEPTEMBER,

1569
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,360
查询外国游轮的
INQUIRING ABOUT SCHEDULES AND PRICES

1570
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,329
时间表和价格？
OF FOREIGN CRUISES?

1571
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,830
如果我去过呢？
WHAT IF I WERE?

1572
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,532
这又不是犯罪，不是吗？
THAT ISN'T A CRIME, IS IT?

1573
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,300
哦，不，不，当然不是。
OH, NO, NO, CERTAINLY NOT.

1574
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:48,270
许多人去乘游轮......
MANY PEOPLE GO ON A CRUISE...

1575
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,806
如果他们能付得起钱的话。
IF THEY CAN PAY FOR IT.

1576
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,543
但你无法支付费用，
BUT YOU COULDN'T PAY FOR IT,

1577
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,444
你能吗，沃尔先生？
COULD YOU, MR. VOLE?

1578
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,513
不。
NO.

1579
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,849
然而，你来到了这家旅行社，
AND YET, YOU CAME INTO THIS TRAVEL AGENCY,

1580
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,451
呃——哦！
UH--OH!

1581
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,753
和一位女士。
WITH A LADY.

1582
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,288
一位金发女郎。
A BLONDE.

1583
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,658
漂亮的金发女郎，我想。
A HONEY BLONDE, I UNDERSTAND.

1584
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:11,960
（观众低声议论）
( spectators murmur )

1585
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:14,696
请告诉我，
TELL ME, PLEASE,

1586
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:17,666
您究竟打算如何付款
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU EXPECT TO PAY

1587
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:21,270
来乘坐如此昂贵且豪华的游轮吗？
FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE AND LUXURIOUS CRUISE?

1588
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:22,438
我不知道。
I DON'T KNOW.

1589
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:23,739
是，呃——如果你不知道的话，
IT WAS, UH-- IF YOU DON'T KNOW,

1590
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:24,973
也许我可以告诉你。
PERHAPS I CAN TELL YOU.

1591
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,043
就在那一天，
ON THAT VERY DAY,

1592
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,413
你听到弗伦奇夫人更改了她的遗嘱，
YOU HEARD MRS. FRENCH ALTER HER WILL,

1593
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,348
把她的大部分钱都留给你。
LEAVING YOU THE BULK OF HER MONEY.

1594
01:07:33,415 --> 01:07:34,716
我没有。
I DIDN'T.

1595
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,218
我对遗嘱一无所知。
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE WILL.

1596
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,586
然后，到了下午，
AND IN THE AFTERNOON,

1597
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,022
您开始计划
YOU SET ABOUT MAKING PLANS

1598
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:42,057
如何花费这些钱。
TO DISPOSE OF THE MONEY.

1599
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,060
不。事实并非如此。
NO. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

1600
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,830
我，呃…
I, UH...

1601
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,066
好吧，我——我在一家酒吧遇见了这个女孩。
WELL, I--I MET THIS GIRL AT A PUB.

1602
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,568
我甚至不记得她的名字，
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HER NAME,

1603
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:53,635
呃，呃，
A-AND, UH,

1604
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:54,670
我们喝了几杯
WE HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS.

1605
01:07:54,736 --> 01:07:56,371
我们一起离开了。
WE LEFT TOGETHER.

1606
01:07:56,438 --> 01:07:58,307
我们经过一个橱窗
WE WENT PAST THIS DISPLAY WINDOW,

1607
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:02,044
里面的海报有蓝色的大海……
AND THERE WERE POSTERS OF BLUE SEAS AND...

1608
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,012
棕榈树，我们就进去了。
PALM TREES, AND WE WENT IN.

1609
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,748
一个男人用一种滑稽的眼神看着我
A MAN GAVE ME SORT OF A FUNNY LOOK

1610
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:08,450
因为我穿得有点破旧，
BECAUSE I WAS DRESSED A LITTLE SHABBY,

1611
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,652
而且，呃，这让我很恼火，
AND, UH, IT IRRITATED ME,

1612
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,390
所以我不断打听最豪华的旅行，
SO I KEPT ASKING FOR THE SWANKIEST TOURS,

1613
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:17,626
你知道，非常奢华，而且……
YOU KNOW, ALL DELUXE, AND...

1614
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,562
甲板上的船舱，就......
CABIN ON THE BOAT DECK, JUST...

1615
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:21,997
预定了一趟旅行。
PUTTING ON AN ACT.

1616
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,465
一趟旅行，嗯嗯。
AN ACT, MM-HMM.

1617
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,566
（咯咯笑）
( chuckling )

1618
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,802
一趟旅行...
AN ACT...

1619
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,838
当你知道自己将继承八万英镑时？
WHEN YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO INHERIT £80,000?

1620
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,106
不，不是那样的。
NO, IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

1621
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,741
我没想过要杀任何人
I DIDN'T THINK OF KILLING ANYBODY

1622
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,043
或者...继承任何金钱。
OR...INHERITING ANY MONEY.

1623
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,578
那弗伦奇夫人一周后被杀
JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT MRS. FRENCH

1624
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,680
仅仅是个巧合吗？
WAS KILLED ONLY ONE WEEK LATER?

1625
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,682
我没有杀她。
I DID NOT KILL HER.

1626
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,417
那么为什么克里斯汀·赫尔姆
THEN WHY DID CHRISTINE HELM

1627
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:44,486
为什么像之前那样作证？
TESTIFY AS SHE DID IN THIS COURT?

1628
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,954
我不知道为什么。
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

1629
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,157
我甚至不知道——
I DON'T EVEN--

1630
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:50,993
为什么仍然称她妻子。
KNOW WHY I STILL CALL HER MY WIFE.

1631
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,229
她一定是疯了。
SHE MUST BE LOSING HER MIND.

1632
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,765
她看上去非常理智
SHE SEEMED REMARKABLY SANE

1633
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,734
在我看来非常沉着冷静。
AND SELF-POSSESSED TO ME.

1634
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,836
那么，疯了，
SO, INSANITY, THEN,

1635
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,305
这是您能想到的唯一原因吗？
IS THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN THINK OF?

1636
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,940
我不明白。
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1637
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,145
上帝啊...
GOD...

1638
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,448
发生了什么事？是什么改变了她？
WHAT'S HAPPENED? WHAT'S CHANGED HER?

1639
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:14,783
我不能告诉你。
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

1640
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,654
当然，除非她说的是实话。
UNLESS, OF COURSE, SHE'S SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

1641
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,356
她说你回家了
SHE SAYS YOU CAME HOME

1642
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,392
你的衣服上沾满了血。
WITH BLOOD ON YOUR CLOTHES.

1643
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,494
我割破了手腕！
I CUT MY WRIST!

1644
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:26,995
您故意割伤手腕。
YOU CUT YOUR WRIST DELIBERATELY.

1645
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:29,698
不！您于十点十分才回到家。
NO! YOU CAME HOME AT TEN MINUTES AFTER 10:00.

1646
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,400
这不是真的！
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

1647
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:32,501
你必须相信我。
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

1648
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,769
你必须相信我。
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

1649
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,871
你必须相信我！
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME!

1650
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,240
而你谋杀了艾米丽·弗伦奇！
AND YOU MURDERED EMILY FRENCH!

1651
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,608
我没有！
I DIDN'T!

1652
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,877
我——我向上帝发誓，我没有！
I--I SWEAR TO GOD, I DIDN'T!

1653
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,581
我从来没有伤害过任何人。
I'VE NEVER HURT ANYONE.

1654
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:47,015
曾经。
EVER.

1655
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,255
我...
I...

1656
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,828
（抽鼻子）哦，天啊。
( sniffs ) OH, GOD.

1657
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,496
这是一场噩梦。
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

1658
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:02,664
（抽鼻子）
( sniffling )

1659
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,533
这是一场...
IT'S SOME...

1660
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,836
可怕……（粗重呼吸）
GHASTLY... ( breathing heavily )

1661
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,771
可怕的噩梦。
HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE.

1662
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,640
（呼吸粗重，颤抖）
( breathing heavily, shakily )

1663
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,686
晚上好，威尔弗雷德爵士。
GOOD EVENING, SIR WILFRED.

1664
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,388
今天过得怎么样？
HOW DID IT GO TODAY?

1665
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,391
哦，威尔弗雷德爵士？
OH, SIR WILFRED?

1666
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,792
我来自鹰和山。
I'M FROM HAWKS AND HILL.

1667
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,761
我给你带来了百慕大短裤
I'VE BROUGHT YOUR BERMUDA SHORTS

1668
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,496
给您试穿。
ALONG FOR A FITTING.

1669
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,098
我的——我的什么？
MY--MY WHAT?

1670
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:38,100
我想你最好现在就试试看，威尔弗雷德爵士。
I THINK YOU'D BETTER SLIP INTO THEM NOW, SIR WILFRED.

1671
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,434
否则，我们就来不及准备了
OTHERWISE, WE'LL NEVER HAVE THEM READY

1672
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,902
为了明天。明天？
FOR TOMORROW. TOMORROW?

1673
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:43,705
亲爱的朋友，我正在参加谋杀案审判。
MY DEAR MAN, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A MURDER TRIAL.

1674
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,108
但到明天下午一切都会结束
BUT IT'LL BE ALL OVER BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON,

1675
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:48,677
联运列车要到 9:40 才会出发。
AND THE BOAT TRAIN DOESN'T LEAVE UNTIL 9:40.

1676
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,612
瞧，你解决了。
LOOK, YOU WORK IT OUT.

1677
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,180
你知道我的体型。
YOU KNOW MY SHAPE.

1678
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,349
你经常拿针扎我。
YOU'VE STABBED IT OFTEN ENOUGH.

1679
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,917
但是威尔弗雷德爵士，
BUT SIR WILFRED,

1680
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:58,487
你必须上楼洗个舒服的温水澡
YOU MUST GO UPSTAIRS AND HAVE A NICE, LUKEWARM BATH

1681
01:10:58,553 --> 01:11:00,622
还要注射您的钙剂。
AND YOUR CALCIUM INJECTION.

1682
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,457
还有一个一大堆的——
AND THERE'S STILL A GREAT--

1683
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,826
行李等着打包。
DEAL OF PACKING TO BE DONE.

1684
01:11:06,928 --> 01:11:10,966
乘联运列车可太荒谬了。
RIDICULOUS TALK ABOUT BOAT TRAINS.

1685
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,002
我们怎么知道？
HOW DO WE KNOW?

1686
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,773
陪审团可能需要花几天时间。
THE JURY MAY BE OUT FOR DAYS.

1687
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:20,108
这个案子不会，我想
NOT IN THIS CASE, I'M AFRAID.

1688
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,577
看起来非常简单明了。
SEEMS FAR TOO OPEN AND SHUT.

1689
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,713
哦，当赫尔姆女士在证人席上时
OH, I WATCHED THEM

1690
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,682
我观察他们
WHEN FRAU HELM WAS ON THE STAND.

1691
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:29,084
他们不喜欢她。
THEY DIDN'T LIKE HER.

1692
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,352
确实，他们不喜欢她，
TRUE, THEY DIDN'T LIKE HER,

1693
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,953
但他们相信她。
BUT THEY BELIEVED HER.

1694
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,356
他们喜欢伦纳德·沃尔，但不相信他。
THEY LIKED LEONARD VOLE, BUT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.

1695
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,258
我必须说的是旅行社的事
I MUST SAY THAT TRAVEL AGENCY BUSINESS

1696
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:37,793
和金发女郎并没有帮助。
WITH THE BLONDE DIDN'T HELP MATTERS.

1697
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:39,761
呃，要雪茄吗，威尔弗雷德？
EH, CIGAR, WILFRED?

1698
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,029
（低声）不。
( whispering ) NO.

1699
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,931
威尔弗雷德，你认为她撒谎了吗？
WILFRED, DO YOU THINK SHE LIED?

1700
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:45,300
你觉得呢？
DO YOU?

1701
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,569
不知道。我不确定。
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE.

1702
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,071
好吧，我确定。
WELL, I AM.

1703
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,273
她撒谎了。
SHE LIED.

1704
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:53,809
我脑子里唯一的问题是“为什么？”
THE ONLY QUESTION IN MY MIND IS, "WHY?"

1705
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,410
她在玩什么？
WHAT'S HER GAME?

1706
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,012
她要做什么？
WHAT'S SHE UP TO?

1707
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,313
为什么？
WHY?

1708
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,581
威尔弗雷德爵士，
SIR WILFRED,

1709
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,717
我希望在你明天的最后发言中
I HOPE THAT IN YOUR FINAL SPEECH TOMORROW

1710
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:02,951
不要让自己
YOU WON'T LET YOURSELF

1711
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,553
过于投入感情。
GET TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

1712
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:07,322
您必须考虑您的身体状况。
YOU MUST THINK OF YOUR PHYSICAL CONDITION.

1713
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,590
他是对的。
HE'S RIGHT.

1714
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,092
我希望看到您珍惜自己。
I WANT TO SEE YOU SAVE YOURSELF.

1715
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:11,693
这不会是您的最后一个案子。
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE YOUR LAST CASE.

1716
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,095
是的。
YES, IT IS.

1717
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:15,697
但在一切结束之前，我仍然是一名律师，
BUT TILL IT'S OVER, I AM STILL A BARRISTER,

1718
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,200
我客户的生命受到威胁。
AND MY CLIENT'S LIFE'S AT STAKE.

1719
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:20,402
这才是最重要的——他的生命。
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS-- HIS LIFE.

1720
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:23,405
他有权利期待我能给他最好的辩护。
HE HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT THE BEST THAT I CAN GIVE.

1721
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,809
如果我不能站着为他做出最后的辩护，
IF I CAN'T STAND UP TO MAKE MY LAST PLEA FOR HIM,

1722
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,512
我就坐着。
I'LL MAKE IT SITTING DOWN.

1723
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,682
如果我感到呼吸困难，
AND IF I FEEL OUT OF BREATH,

1724
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,751
我要吃一颗药。
I'LL TAKE A PILL.

1725
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:38,587
吃两粒药。
I'LL TAKE TWO PILLS.

1726
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:40,288
我把药都拿上。
I'LL TAKE THE LOT.

1727
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,591
还有盒子。
AND THE BOX AS WELL.

1728
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:44,726
（电话铃声响起）
( telephone rings )

1729
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,496
是的？
YES?

1730
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:49,698
伦敦女人：是威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨爵士的办公室吗？
Cockney Woman: HAVE I GOT SIR WILFRED ROBARTS' OFFICE?

1731
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,732
是的。
YOU HAVE.

1732
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:51,900
请他听电话。
PUT HIM ON.

1733
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,101
嗯，你是谁？
WELL, WHO IS THIS?

1734
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,836
关你屁事。
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

1735
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,404
我有东西要卖给他。
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE TO SELL HIM.

1736
01:12:56,471 --> 01:12:57,773
不，我很抱歉，但是——
NO, I'M SORRY, BUT--

1737
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,674
伦纳德·沃尔的案子案。
THE LEONARD VOLE CASE.

1738
01:12:59,741 --> 01:13:00,842
伦纳德·沃尔？
LEONARD VOLE?

1739
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,879
我有他妻子的东西。
I'VE GOT THE GOODS ON HIS WIFE.

1740
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:04,946
是的，呃，请等一下。
YEAH, UH, JUST A MOMENT.

1741
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:06,448
有一个女人说
THERE'S A WOMAN WHO SAYS

1742
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:09,851
她有关于沃尔妻子的“好东西”。
THAT SHE HAS "THE GOODS" ON MR. VOLE'S WIFE.

1743
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,890
我是威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨。
WILFRED ROBARTS, HERE.

1744
01:13:14,956 --> 01:13:17,692
在蒂尔比街见我。
MEET ME ON TILBEY STREET.

1745
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:20,262
在码头边。 27号。
BY THE DOCKS. NUMBER 27.

1746
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:23,165
二楼。我会等一个小时。
SECOND FLOOR. I'LL WAIT AN HOUR.

1747
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:25,600
多带点钱。
BRING PLENTY OF MONEY.

1748
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,369
一个人来。
AND COME ALONE.

1749
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,337
呃……这是谁？
UH...WHO IS THIS?

1750
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,073
该死。
DAMN.

1751
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,344
喝醉酒的巫婆
DRUNKEN WITCH.

1752
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,214
每次谋杀案审判，我们总会收到一些这样的消息。
EVERY MURDER TRIAL, WE ALWAYS GET SOME OF THEM.

1753
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,817
总是有一些最后通牒。
ALWAYS WITH SOME ULTIMATUM.

1754
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:43,919
“在蒂尔比街见我。”
"MEET ME AT TILBEY STREET."

1755
01:13:43,985 --> 01:13:45,654
“在码头边。”
"DOWN BY THE DOCKS."

1756
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,655
（笑声）
( chuckles )

1757
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:48,790
“多带点钱。”
"BRING PLENTY OF MONEY."

1758
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,859
废话！
BALDERDASH!

1759
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,528
废话——（叹气）
BALDERD-- ( sighs )

1760
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:58,633
（抱怨）
( grumbles )

1761
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:16,685
以我的情况，
I'M NOT GOING ON SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE

1762
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:18,220
我不会为了喝醉的泼妇
IN MY CONDITION,

1763
01:14:18,286 --> 01:14:22,123
而白费力气……
JUST BECAUSE SOME DRUNKEN HARRIDAN...

1764
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,825
威尔弗雷德爵士，您——
SIR WILFRED, YOU--

1765
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,461
你跟我一起去，梅休。
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, MAYHEW.

1766
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,907
梅休：天哪，威尔弗雷德爵士，我们在哪儿？
Mayhew: GOOD HEAVENS, SIR WILFRED, WHERE ARE WE?

1767
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,909
看起来确实很险恶。
IT LOOKS POSITIVELY SINISTER.

1768
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,078
威尔弗雷德爵士：稳住，梅休。
Sir Wilfred: STEADY, MAYHEW.

1769
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:51,386
啊，我们到了，威廉姆斯。
AH, HERE WE ARE, WILLIAMS.

1770
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:52,621
减速。
SLOW DOWN.

1771
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:54,122
我不喜欢这里。
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1772
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,057
我一点也不喜欢这里。
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

1773
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,683
你留在这里，梅休。
YOU STAY HERE, MAYHEW.

1774
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,819
不。我不能让你一个人上去。
NO. I CAN'T LET YOU GO UP THERE ALONE.

1775
01:15:24,886 --> 01:15:25,854
太危险了。
IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

1776
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,622
我和你一起去。
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

1777
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,025
她想单独见我。
SHE WANTS TO SEE ME ALONE.

1778
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,761
就按她说的。
AND SHE SHALL.

1779
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:34,296
很好。
VERY WELL.

1780
01:15:34,362 --> 01:15:35,897
但如果你十分钟后还没有回来
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT BACK IN TEN MINUTES,

1781
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,265
我就去追你。
I'M COMING AFTER YOU.

1782
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,134
二楼，我确信。
SECOND FLOOR, I BELIEVE.

1783
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:48,576
小心点，老朋友。
CAREFUL, OLD FRIEND.

1784
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:49,644
保持冷静。
STAY CALM.

1785
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,548
（楼梯的咯吱声）
( stairs groaning )

1786
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,521
梅休：注意，不要绊倒，威尔弗雷德爵士。
Mayhew: MIND YOU DON'T TRIP, SIR WILFRED.

1787
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,531
（咳嗽）
( coughing )

1788
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,080
（敲两下）
( knocks twice )

1789
01:16:29,784 --> 01:16:31,219
（喘息、咳嗽）
( wheezes, coughs )

1790
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,555
（沙哑地）好，好。
( hoarsely ) WELL, WELL.

1791
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:36,558
威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨爵士。
SIR WILFRED ROBARTS.

1792
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:38,093
哈！
HA!

1793
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,863
你是谁？
WHO ARE YOU?

1794
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,533
是谁不重要。
NEVER YOU MIND.

1795
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,935
（咳嗽、抽鼻子）
( coughs, sniffs )

1796
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,304
没戴假发，我都认不出你了。
I WOULDN'T HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU WITHOUT YOUR WIG.

1797
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,840
你戴上假发看起来很可爱，确实如此。
YOU LOOK LOVELY IN THEM WIGS, YOU DO.

1798
01:16:51,906 --> 01:16:53,274
谢谢。
THANK YOU.

1799
01:16:53,341 --> 01:16:56,144
（嗅了嗅）我的绅士朋友……
( sniffs ) WOULD MY GENTLEMAN FRIEND...

1800
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,146
想喝一杯吗？
CARE FOR A DRINK?

1801
01:16:58,213 --> 01:16:59,481
不，谢谢。
NO, THANK YOU.

1802
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:02,684
你要给我什么？
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME?

1803
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:03,918
信。
LETTERS.

1804
01:17:03,985 --> 01:17:06,688
就是我手上的。
THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT.

1805
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,623
信...
LETTERS...

1806
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,192
他的妻子写的。
THAT WIFE OF HIS WROTE.

1807
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,161
你是说，克里斯汀·沃尔写的信
YOU MEAN, LETTERS WRITTEN BY CHRISTINE VOLE

1808
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,696
给她丈夫？
TO HER HUSBAND?

1809
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:15,864
她的丈夫？
HER HUSBAND?

1810
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,566
哈！别让我笑。
HA! DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

1811
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:20,735
可怜又讨厌的笨蛋。
POOR RUDDY CHUMP.

1812
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,938
他可是被耍了。
HE'S BEEN TOOK IN GOOD AND PROPER, HE HAS.

1813
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:26,908
这些信能证明。
AND THESE LETTERS PROVE IT.

1814
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:27,942
我可以看看吗？
MAY I SEE THEM?

1815
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:29,310
你可以看一封，
YOU CAN SEE ONE,

1816
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:31,646
然后我要钱。
AND THEN I WANTS ME MONEY.

1817
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:32,847
100 英镑。
£100.

1818
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,315
100 英镑？
£100?

1819
01:17:34,382 --> 01:17:36,651
要么接受，要么走人。
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

1820
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:37,752
好的。
ALL RIGHT.

1821
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,654
小美人
LITTLE BEAUTIES.

1822
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,689
你会看到的。
YOU'LL SEE.

1823
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,796
（咳嗽）
( coughs )

1824
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:06,714
你现在可以把眼镜摘掉了。
YOU CAN TAKE THAT PIECE OF GLASS OUT NOW.

1825
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:11,886
信是真的吗？
ARE THEY AUTHENTIC?

1826
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,455
是她写的，没错。
THEY'RE HERS, ALL RIGHT.

1827
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,169
你从哪弄到的？
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

1828
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,371
有什么区别吗？
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

1829
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:32,407
只要她得到应得的报应。
AS LONG AS SHE GETS WHAT'S COMING TO HER.

1830
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,709
你对她有什么不满？
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT AGAINST HER?

1831
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,246
这里！
HERE!

1832
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:43,485
我给你看点让你做恶梦的东西，先生。
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DREAM ABOUT, MISTER.

1833
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,189
想吻我吗，亲爱的？
WANT TO KISS ME, DUCKY?

1834
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,392
（咯咯笑）
( cackles )

1835
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:55,597
不，你不会的。
NO, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD.

1836
01:18:55,663 --> 01:18:58,199
克莉丝汀·沃尔对干的吗？
DID CHRISTINE VOLE DO THAT TO YOU?

1837
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:01,736
可以这么说。
YOU COULD SAY AS MUCH.

1838
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:04,172
我的男人
CHAP I WAS GOING WITH

1839
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,942
和她偷偷私会，
GOT TO SEEING HER ON THE SLY,

1840
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,478
被我抓了正着。
AND I CAUGHT THEM TOGETHER.

1841
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:14,315
我骂了她，不是吗？
TOLD HER WHAT I THOUGHT OF HER, DIDN'T I?

1842
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,950
我男人给我脸上留下这些。
AND HE GIVE ME THIS.

1843
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:21,156
我等了很多年
I'VE WAITED YEARS TO PAY HER BACK,

1844
01:19:21,222 --> 01:19:24,159
现在终于可以报仇了。
AND NOW IT'S COME.

1845
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:25,793
女士，我深感抱歉。
I'M DEEPLY SORRY, MADAM.

1846
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,263
哈！我打赌！
HA! I'LL BET!

1847
01:19:28,329 --> 01:19:29,964
梅休：威尔弗雷德爵士？
Mayhew: SIR WILFRED?

1848
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,300
好的。
ALL RIGHT.

1849
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,801
好吧，我——
ALL RIGHT, I--

1850
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:35,537
我——我这就下去。
I--I'LL BE WITH YOU.

1851
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:42,877
女士，
MADAM,

1852
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,513
我现在喝你的威士忌。
I'LL DRINK YOUR WHISKEY NOW.

1853
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,820
法警：带伦纳德·沃尔。
Usher: PUT UP LEONARD VOLE.

1854
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,790
（轻声细语）
( soft chattering )

1855
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,395
你可以坐下来。
YOU MAY SIT DOWN.

1856
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,531
（清嗓子）辩方传唤了
( clears throat ) SINCE THE DEFENSE

1857
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,300
唯一一名证人，
HAS CALLED BUT ONE WITNESS,

1858
01:20:05,366 --> 01:20:07,335
因此有权最后旁听。
IT HAS THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD LAST.

1859
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,736
因此，迈尔斯先生，
THEREFORE, MR. MYERS,

1860
01:20:08,803 --> 01:20:10,071
如果你准备好了，
IF YOU ARE READY,

1861
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,640
让我们听检方作最后的发言。
LET US HAVE THE FINAL SPEECH FOR THE PROSECUTION.

1862
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:13,708
迈尔斯：法官大人，
Myers: MY LORD,

1863
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,777
评审团成员们，
MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

1864
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:18,513
我相信在本案中
I BELIEVE THE ONLY CONCLUSION

1865
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,949
唯一确定的结论
TO BE DRAWN IN THIS CASE

1866
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:23,484
是裁定犯人
IS A VERDICT OF "GUILTY"

1867
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,819
“有罪”。
AGAINST THE PRISONER.

1868
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,788
我——我现在就——
I--I WILL NOW--

1869
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:29,190
在……的过程中 -
IN THE COURSE OF--

1870
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,725
（低声）
( murmuring )

1871
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,361
我认为你最好重新开始，
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER BEGIN AGAIN,

1872
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:34,596
迈尔斯先生。
MR. MYERS.

1873
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:35,997
也就是说，如果威尔弗雷德爵士
THAT IS, IF SIR WILFRED

1874
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,899
希望继续庭审流程的话。
IS AT ALL INTERESTED IN OUR PROCEEDINGS.

1875
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,235
哦，的确。
OH, I AM. INDEED.

1876
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:43,171
我现在请求辩方允许
I NOW ASK THAT THE CASE FOR THE DEFENSE

1877
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,273
继续询问。
TO BE REOPENED.

1878
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,908
我希望传唤一名证人。
I'D LIKE A WITNESS TO BE RECALLED.

1879
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,943
法官大人，我——我必须，呃，
MY LORD, I--I MUST, UH,

1880
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,445
强烈抗议。
STRENUOUSLY PROTEST.

1881
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:52,046
我昨晚才拿到
EVIDENCE OF THE MOST STARTLING NATURE

1882
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,582
最令人震惊的根本证据。
HAS COME INTO MY POSSESSION ONLY LAST NIGHT.

1883
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,651
我博学的朋友给法庭的建议
THE COURSE MY LEARNED FRIEND PROPOSES TO TAKE US

1884
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,553
是没有先例的！
IS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED!

1885
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,055
我预料到我朋友会反对。
I ANTICIPATED MY FRIEND'S OBJECTION.

1886
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,759
我已经准备好以充分的先例来应对它。
I AM PREPARED TO MEET IT WITH AMPLE PRECEDENT.

1887
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,462
国王对斯蒂尔曼案，
THE CASE OF THE CROWN AGAINST STILLMAN,

1888
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,631
第 463 页。
ON PAGE 463.

1889
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:11,799
1926年。

1890
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:15,370
上诉案件。
APPEAL CASE.

1891
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:18,439
此外，还有国王对波特案。
ALSO, THE CROWN AGAINST PORTER.

1892
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,175
1930 年 8 月 11 日。
AUGUST 11th, 1930.

1893
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:25,013
温彻斯特巡回法庭，第 231 页。
WINCHESTER ASSIZES, ON PAGE 231.

1894
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:29,417
还有，
AND FURTHER,

1895
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,818
沙利文案。
THE CASE OF SULLIVAN.

1896
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:33,288
我相信阁下会记得，
I'M SURE YOUR LORDSHIP WILL REMEMBER IT,

1897
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,423
是您作为控方出庭的。
SINCE YOU APPEARED FOR THE PROSECUTION.

1898
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,525
是我吗？是的。
I DID? YES.

1899
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:42,697
哦，是的，我现在想起来了。
OH, YES, I DO RECALL NOW.

1900
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:46,000
威尔弗雷德爵士，你有什么新证据？
WHAT IS THIS NEW EVIDENCE YOU HAVE, SIR WILFRED?

1901
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,602
信，法官大人。
LETTERS, MY LORD.

1902
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,471
克里斯汀·赫尔姆的来信。
LETTERS FROM CHRISTINE HELM.

1903
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:53,207
法官大人，检方继续提出异议。
MY LORD, THE PROSECUTION CONTINUES ITS OBJECTION.

1904
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:54,742
如果我没记错的话
IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT,

1905
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,978
如果您自己反对
IN THE CASE OF YOUR OWN OBJECTION

1906
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:58,613
皇冠VS皇冠沙利文，
IN THE CROWN VS. SULLIVAN,

1907
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,581
您的反对意见已被维持。
YOUR OBJECTION WAS UPHELD.

1908
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:05,753
你的记忆力，这一次，对你不利，迈尔斯先生。
YOUR MEMORY, FOR ONCE, SERVES YOU ILL, MR. MYERS.

1909
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,290
我的反对意见当时被
MY OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED AT THE TIME

1910
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,692
被斯温顿法官驳回，
BY MR. JUSTICE SWINDON,

1911
01:22:10,758 --> 01:22:15,029
正如你现在的样子，由我来完成。
AS YOURS IS NOW, BY ME.

1912
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:23,838
传克里斯汀·赫尔姆。
CALL CHRISTINE HELM.

1913
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,474
传克里斯汀·赫尔姆！
CALL CHRISTINE HELM!

1914
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,543
传克里斯汀·赫尔姆！
CALL CHRISTINE HELM!

1915
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,578
（低声嘀咕）
( murmuring )

1916
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,589
（嘀咕声继续）
( murmuring continues )

1917
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,593
如果您对沃尔仍有疑问，
IF YOU'VE STILL GOT YOUR DOUBTS ABOUT VOLE,

1918
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,398
我不介意赌你一小盒雪茄。
I DON'T MIND BETTING YOU A VERY SMALL BOX OF CIGARS.

1919
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,200
赫尔姆夫人。
MRS. HELM.

1920
01:22:52,266 --> 01:22:54,469
您知道您仍在宣誓吗？
YOU APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE STILL UNDER OATH?

1921
01:22:54,535 --> 01:22:56,270
克里斯汀：是的。
Christine: YES.

1922
01:22:56,337 --> 01:22:57,805
你认识一个叫马克斯的人吗？
DO YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED MAX?

1923
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,540
我不知道你的意思。
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

1924
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:02,243
威尔弗雷德爵士：这是一个简单的问题。
Sir Wilfred: IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.

1925
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,312
你认识一个叫马克斯的人吗？
DO YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED MAX?

1926
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:05,913
当然不认识。
CERTAINLY NOT.

1927
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,348
哦。
OH.

1928
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,050
嗯，这是一个相当常见的名字。
WELL, IT'S A FAIRLY COMMON NAME.

1929
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:11,386
但你的意思是你从来不认识
AND YET YOU MEAN YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN

1930
01:23:11,452 --> 01:23:13,488
一个名叫麦克斯的男人？
A MAN BY THE NAME OF MAX?

1931
01:23:13,554 --> 01:23:15,757
哦，也许在德国，
OH, PERHAPS IN GERMANY,

1932
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:18,025
但那是很久以前的事了。
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

1933
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:20,928
我不会要求你回到那么久。
I SHALL NOT ASK YOU TO GO BACK AS FAR AS THAT.

1934
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:22,230
只需几周...
JUST A FEW WEEKS...

1935
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:25,767
到 9 月 20 日为止。
TO SEPTEMBER THE 20th, LAST.

1936
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,869
你那里有什么？
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

1937
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:29,971
一封信。
A LETTER.

1938
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:34,008
我建议9月20日
I SUGGEST THAT ON THE 20th OF SEPTEMBER

1939
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,377
你写了一封信——
YOU WROTE A CERTAIN LETTER--

1940
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:37,779
我不知道你在说什么。
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1941
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:39,814
写给一个名叫马克斯的人。
ADDRESSED TO A MAN NAMED MAX.

1942
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,783
我没有做那样的事。
I DID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

1943
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:44,819
这封信只是一系列信中的一封
THE LETTER WAS BUT ONE OF A SERIES

1944
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,521
写给同一个人。
WRITTEN TO THE SAME MAN.

1945
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:47,955
这些都是谎言。
THESE ARE LIES.

1946
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:49,190
全是谎言的！
ALL LIES!

1947
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,526
让我们说，你似乎一直在，
YOU WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ON, LET US SAY,

1948
01:23:51,592 --> 01:23:54,429
与这个男人有“亲密关系”。
ON "INTIMATE TERMS" WITH THIS MAN.

1949
01:23:54,495 --> 01:23:55,430
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

1950
01:23:55,496 --> 01:23:57,031
这不是真的！
THAT ISN'T TRUE!

1951
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,699
法官：囚犯为了自己的利益
Judge: THE PRISONER IN HIS OWN INTEREST

1952
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:00,234
将保持沉默。
WILL REMAIN SILENT.

1953
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:05,640
我只关心一封特定的信件。
I'M CONCERNED ONLY WITH ONE PARTICULAR LETTER.

1954
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,509
“我亲爱的麦克斯，
"MY BELOVED MAX,

1955
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,078
“发生了一件非同寻常的事情。
"AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS HAPPENED.

1956
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:14,248
我相信我们所有的困难都可以结束。”
I BELIEVE ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES MAY BE ENDED."

1957
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,584
这是伪造的。
THIS IS A FORGERY.

1958
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,352
这不是我的。
IT ISN'T MINE.

1959
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:20,721
这甚至不是我的信纸。
IT ISN'T EVEN MY LETTER PAPER.

1960
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:23,124
不是吗？不。
IT ISN'T? NO.

1961
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,727
我把信写在小蓝纸上......
I WRITE MY LETTERS ON SMALL, BLUE PAPER...

1962
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:28,963
上面有我名字的缩写。
WITH MY INITIALS ON IT.

1963
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:33,401
像这样？
LIKE THIS?

1964
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,903
（观众低声议论）
( spectators murmur )

1965
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:43,110
这恰好是我裁缝的便条
THIS HAPPENS TO BE A NOTE FROM MY TAILOR

1966
01:24:43,177 --> 01:24:46,481
来制作一条合身的百慕大短裤。
FOR A PAIR OF EXTREMELY BECOMING BERMUDA SHORTS.

1967
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:49,517
（观众笑）
( spectators chuckle )

1968
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:52,186
（咯咯笑）
( chuckling )

1969
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,655
“狐狸威尔弗雷德”，这就是我们对他的称呼，
"WILFRED THE FOX," THAT'S WHAT WE CALL HIM,

1970
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,023
这就是他。
AND THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

1971
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,725
威尔弗雷德爵士：现在，赫尔姆夫人，
Sir Wilfred: NOW, MRS. HELM,

1972
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,528
您很体贴的辨认了您的信纸。
YOU'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY YOUR LETTER PAPER.

1973
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,597
您愿意聘请专家吗
WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE AN EXPERT

1974
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:04,699
识别您的笔迹？
IDENTIFY YOUR HANDWRITING?

1975
01:25:04,765 --> 01:25:07,268
该死！该死！
DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU!

1976
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:08,636
放过她！
LEAVE HER ALONE!

1977
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,738
该死！赫尔姆夫人。
DAMN YOU! MRS. HELM.

1978
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,507
让我离开这里。
LET ME GET OUT OF HERE.

1979
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:14,308
（低声）放开我！
( murmuring ) LET ME GO!

1980
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,676
赫尔姆夫人！
MRS. HELM!

1981
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,312
法警，给证人一把椅子。
USHER, GIVE THE WITNESS A CHAIR.

1982
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:27,855
威尔弗雷德爵士，您现在可以读一下这封信吗
SIR WILFRED, WILL YOU NOW READ THE LETTER

1983
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:29,590
以便让陪审团能听到吗？
SO THE JURY CAN HEAR IT?

1984
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:35,029
“我心爱的麦克斯。
"MY BELOVED MAX.

1985
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:37,131
“发生了一件非同寻常的事情。
"AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS HAPPENED.

1986
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,767
“我们所有的困难可能很快就会得到解决。
"ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES MAY SOON BE SOLVED.

1987
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,803
“伦纳德涉嫌谋杀老太太
"LEONARD IS SUSPECTED OF MURDERING THE OLD LADY

1988
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:44,405
“我告诉过你了。
"I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

1989
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,642
“他唯一的希望是一个不在场证明
"HIS ONLY HOPE OF AN ALIBI

1990
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:49,243
“取决于我。
"DEPENDS ON ME.

1991
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,681
“假设我证明在谋杀发生时——
"SUPPOSE I TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS NOT AT HOME WITH ME

1992
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:56,217
“他没有我在一起在家
"AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER--

1993
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:59,787
“他带着袖子上的血回到家——
"THAT HE CAME HOME WITH BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES--

1994
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,556
“他向我承认
"THAT HE ADMITTED TO ME

1995
01:26:01,622 --> 01:26:05,192
“他杀了她？
"THAT HE KILLED HER?

1996
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:08,596
“伦纳德说他永远不会让我离开他。
"LEONARD SAYS HE WOULD NEVER LET ME LEAVE HIM.

1997
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,631
“但是如果成功了，
"BUT IF THIS SUCCEEDS,

1998
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:13,668
“他会离开我的。
"HE WILL BE LEAVING ME.

01:26:26,914 --> 01:26:30,685
（喋喋不休，低语）
( chattering, murmuring )

2005
01:26:30,751 --> 01:26:32,820
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

2006
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:36,757
你能回到证人席吗，赫尔姆夫人？
WILL YOU GO BACK TO THE WITNESS BOX, MRS. HELM?

2007
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,574
我现在再次问你，
I NOW ASK YOU AGAIN,

2008
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,843
克里斯汀·赫尔姆,
CHRISTINE HELM,

2009
01:26:55,910 --> 01:27:00,881
这封信是你写的吗？
DID YOU WRITE THIS LETTER?

2010
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:11,292
法官：在回答之前，赫尔姆夫人，
Judge: BEFORE ANSWERING, MRS. HELM,

2011
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,960
我想警告你——
I WISH TO WARN YOU--

2012
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:16,297
如果您已在本法庭犯下伪证罪，
IF YOU HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED PERJURY IN THIS COURTROOM,

2013
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:18,666
我必须建议你
I MUST ADVISE YOU

2014
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,335
不要加重你的犯罪行为。
NOT TO ADD TO YOUR CRIME.

2015
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:31,278
是我...
I...

2016
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,547
写的...
WROTE...

2017
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:35,449
这封信。
THE LETTER.

2018
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,689
我不断问自己，威尔弗雷德爵士，
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF, SIR WILFRED,

2019
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:42,757
哪个更硬——
WHICH IS THE HARDER--

2020
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:44,759
你的头部还是你的动脉？
YOUR HEAD OR YOUR ARTERIES?

2021
01:27:45,826 --> 01:27:47,328
好吧，我只能说你——
WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU--

2022
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:49,163
你最好别再碰运气了。
YOU'D BETTER STOP CHANCING YOUR LUCK.

2023
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,731
好了，我们都收拾好了，医生。
WELL, WE'RE ALL PACKED, DOCTOR.

2024
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,266
行李在车里。
THE LUGGAGE IS IN THE CAR.

2025
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,569
哦，我希望陪审团不会占用整个下午的时间。
OH, I HOPE THE JURY DOESN'T TAKE ALL AFTERNOON.

2026
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:57,438
我承认。
I CONCEDE.

2027
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,440
恭喜。
CONGRATULATIONS.

2028
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,109
还没有。
NOT YET.

2029
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:04,078
哦，来吧，一切都结束了。
OH, COME NOW, IT'S ALL OVER.

2030
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:06,414
行李都打包好了。
WRAPPED UP NEAT AND TIDY.

2031
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,815
怎么了？
WHAT'S WRONG?

2032
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,650
一切。
EVERYTHING.

2033
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:12,753
一切都有点太顺利了。
IT'S ALL JUST A LITTLE TOO NEAT.

2034
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,922
太整洁了。
TOO TIDY.

2035
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:22,430
这正是它的问题所在。
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

2036
01:28:22,496 --> 01:28:24,765
您并不担心判决，是吗？
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE VERDICT, ARE YOU?

2037
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,801
我不担心他们的判决...
IT'S NOT THEIR JUDGMENT...

2038
01:28:26,867 --> 01:28:29,103
而是我的。
THAT WORRIES ME.

2039
01:28:31,672 --> 01:28:33,974
担心我的判断。
IT'S MINE.

2040
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,769
带沃尔！
PUT UP VOLE!

2041
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,212
评审团成员们，
MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

2042
01:29:11,278 --> 01:29:12,813
你们都同意你的裁定吗？
ARE YOU ALL AGREED UPON YOUR VERDICT?

2043
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,181
是的。
WE ARE.

2044
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:17,251
你们认为庭上的犯人？
DO YOU FIND THE PRISONER AT THE BAR,

2045
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:19,620
伦纳德·沃尔有罪还是无罪？
LEONARD VOLE, GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?

2046
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,455
无罪，陛下。
NOT GUILTY, MY LORD.

2047
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:24,091
（观众低声议论、欢呼）
( spectators murmur, cheer )

2048
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,302
法警：安静！
Usher: SILENCE!

2049
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:37,505
安静！
SILENCE!

2050
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,243
伦纳德·沃尔。
LEONARD VOLE.

2051
01:29:42,309 --> 01:29:44,845
你被判无罪
YOU ARE FOUND NOT GUILTY OF THE CHARGE

2052
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,847
并即刻释放
AND ARE HEREBY DISCHARGED

2053
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,517
并可以自由离开法庭。
AND FREE TO LEAVE THE COURT.

2054
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:52,520
法警：起立！
Usher: BE UPSTANDING!

2055
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:57,424
庭上的
ALL PERSONS

2056
01:29:57,491 --> 01:29:58,692
所有人
WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

2057
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:00,594
在中央刑事法院的大人、
BEFORE MY LORDS, THE QUEEN'S JUSTICES

2058
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,596
女王大法官面前，
OF THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT,

2059
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:04,465
现在可以离席，
MAY DEPART HENCE,

2060
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:06,967
上帝保佑女王！
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!

2061
01:30:13,507 --> 01:30:15,876
（轻声呢喃）
( soft murmuring )

2062
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,454
（嘀咕声继续）
( murmuring continues )

2063
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:29,723
谢谢你，先生。
THANK YOU, SIR.

2064
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:32,426
一切一切。
FOR EVERYTHING.

2065
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,527
你太棒了。
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

2066
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,163
只能说我们很幸运。
JUST SAY WE WERE LUCKY ALL AROUND.

2067
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,132
先生，典狱长有您的物品。
THE WARDEN HAS YOUR BELONGINGS, SIR.

2068
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,600
他会带你签署文件
HE'LL TAKE YOU TO SIGN THE PAPERS

2069
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,734
然后释放你。
AND THEN RELEASE YOU.

2070
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:42,102
好的。我和你一起去。
GREAT. I'LL GO WITH YOU.

2071
01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:43,137
我给你带来了帽子和外套。
I BROUGHT YOUR HAT AND COAT.

2072
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:44,371
我们快点吧——
LET'S GO QUICKLY--

2073
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:46,440
在他们改变主意之前。
BEFORE THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND.

2074
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,645
他很潇洒，不是吗？
HE'S QUITE CHIPPER, ISN'T HE?

2075
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:54,181
就在一小时前，他的一只脚还踏上了绞刑架
ONLY AN HOUR AGO, HE HAD ONE FOOT ON THE GALLOWS

2076
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,250
另一只脚在香蕉皮上。
AND THE OTHER ON A BANANA SKIN.

2077
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:58,953
你应该感到高兴，威尔弗雷德。
YOU OUGHT TO BE PLEASED, WILFRED.

2078
01:31:00,821 --> 01:31:02,423
你不是吗？
AREN'T YOU?

2079
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:04,091
并没有。
NOT YET.

2080
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,727
我们躲开了绞刑架
WE'VE DISPOSED OF THE GALLOWS,

2081
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:09,530
但香蕉皮还在
BUT THERE'S STILL THAT BANANA SKIN

2082
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:10,798
某个地方...
SOMEWHERE...

2083
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:14,435
某个人的脚下。
UNDER SOMEBODY'S FOOT.

2084
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,875
在这里等一下，女士，
WAIT IN HERE, MADAM,

2085
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:22,176
等我们控制住人群。
TILL WE GET RID OF THE CROWD.

2086
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,944
快点，分开人群！
COME ON, BREAK IT UP!

2087
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,283
先生，您准备好了吗？
ARE YOU READY, SIR?

2088
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:32,653
普利姆索尔小姐正在等着呢。
BECAUSE MISS PLIMSOLL WILL BE WAITING.

2089
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,324
让我喝完最后一杯可可，卡特……
LET ME FINISH THE LAST OF THE COCOA, CARTER...

2090
01:31:38,592 --> 01:31:42,062
我还在她管辖范围之外。
WHILE I'M STILL BEYOND HER JURISDICTION.

2091
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:57,144
你们英国人可以变得如此情绪化。
YOU BRITISH CAN GET SO EMOTIONAL.

2092
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,114
我为我的同胞道歉。
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY COMPATRIOTS.

2093
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:02,182
啊，没关系。
AH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

2094
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:04,518
我不介意被呼来喝去或者指名道姓，
I DON'T MIND BEING PUSHED AROUND OR CALLED NAMES,

2095
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:08,289
但现在我确实穿着丝袜走了很久。
BUT I DO HAVE A LONG RUN, NOW, IN MY NYLONS.

2096
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:09,823
如果你不熟悉
IN CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR

2097
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,860
根据我们的监狱规定...
WITH OUR PRISON REGULATIONS...

2098
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:15,863
不允许穿丝袜。
NO SILK STOCKINGS ALLOWED.

2099
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,831
监狱？
PRISON?

2100
01:32:17,898 --> 01:32:18,899
我会进监狱吗？
WILL I GO TO PRISON?

2101
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,301
事实上，你肯定会
INDEED, YOU'LL CERTAINLY

2102
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:22,403
被指控作伪证，
BE CHARGED WITH PERJURY,

2103
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:23,404
你做了，
TRIED FOR IT,

2104
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,739
就应该去监狱。
AND TO PRISON YOU SHALL GO.

2105
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:27,141
好吧。
WELL.

2106
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:28,776
这不会是终生的，不是吗？
IT WON'T BE FOR LIFE, WILL IT?

2107
01:32:28,842 --> 01:32:30,811
如果我是法官，那就是。
IF I WERE THE JUDGE, IT WOULD BE.

2108
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,714
你讨厌我，不是吗？
YOU LOATHE ME, DON'T YOU?

2109
01:32:33,781 --> 01:32:36,550
我是一个多么邪恶的女人，
WHAT A WICKED WOMAN I AM,

2110
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:39,353
以及你如何出色地揭露了我。
AND HOW BRILLIANTLY YOU EXPOSED ME.

2111
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,590
伟大的威尔弗雷德·罗巴茨爵士再次做到了。
THE GREAT SIR WILFRED ROBARTS DID IT AGAIN.

2112
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:45,626
好吧...
WELL...

2113
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:47,895
让我告诉你一件事。
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

2114
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,663
你不是一个人做的。
YOU DIDN'T DO IT ALONE.

2115
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,265
你得到了帮助。
YOU HAD HELP.

2116
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:52,633
你的目的是什么？
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT?

2117
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,869
伦纳德自由了。
LEONARD IS FREE.

2118
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,571
我们做到了。
AND WE DID IT.

2119
01:32:57,638 --> 01:32:58,706
我们？
WE?

2120
01:32:58,772 --> 01:33:00,307
我们。
WE.

2121
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:03,444
你还记得我第一次来看你吗？
YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO SEE YOU?

2122
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:05,145
你告诉我
AND YOU TOLD ME

2123
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:07,648
没有陪审团会相信一个爱妻
THAT NO JURY WOULD BELIEVE AN ALIBI

2124
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:08,916
所做的不在场证明，
GIVEN BY A LOVING WIFE,

2125
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,118
无论她如何发誓
NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHE SWORE

2126
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:12,519
她的丈夫是无辜的？
THAT HER HUSBAND WAS INNOCENT?

2127
01:33:12,586 --> 01:33:14,688
这让我有了一个想法。
THAT GAVE ME THE IDEA.

2128
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,223
什么想法？
WHAT IDEA?

2129
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,793
我应该成为证人的想法。
THE IDEA THAT I SHOULD BE A WITNESS.

2130
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,795
但不是为我的丈夫——不。
BUT NOT FOR MY HUSBAND--NO.

2131
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:24,331
而是为检方。
FOR THE PROSECUTION.

2132
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:27,167
我应该发誓伦纳德有罪
THAT I SHOULD SWEAR THAT LEONARD WAS GUILTY,

2133
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:29,870
并且你应该揭露我
AND THAT YOU SHOULD EXPOSE ME

2134
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,239
是一个恶毒的骗子，
AS A VICIOUS LIAR,

2135
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:36,143
因为只有这样陪审团才会相信
BECAUSE ONLY THEN WOULD THE JURY BELIEVE

2136
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,712
我的丈夫是无辜的。
THAT MY HUSBAND WAS INNOCENT.

2137
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,748
所以...
SO...

2138
01:33:40,814 --> 01:33:44,118
现在你知道整个故事了，威尔弗雷德爵士。
NOW YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY, SIR WILFRED.

2139
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,589
（带有伦敦口音）我给你看点让你做恶梦的东西，先生。
( with Cockney accent ) I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DREAM ABOUT, MISTER.

2140
01:33:48,655 --> 01:33:51,392
想吻我吗，亲爱的？
WANT TO KISS ME, DUCKY?

2141
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:54,495
我原本有所怀疑。
I SUSPECTED SOMETHING.

2142
01:33:54,561 --> 01:33:56,964
但没想到是这样。
BUT NEVER THAT.

2143
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:00,267
谢谢你的夸奖。
THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

2144
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:04,138
我已经当演员这么久
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS AN ACTRESS.

2145
01:34:04,204 --> 01:34:07,875
从未扮演过如此重要的角色。
BUT I HAVE NEVER PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART.

2146
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:09,877
还有那些蓝色的信件？
AND ALL THOSE BLUE LETTERS?

2147
01:34:09,943 --> 01:34:12,613
我花了几个小时才写出来......
IT TOOK ME HOURS TO WRITE THEM...

2148
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:14,782
想出一个麦克斯。
TO INVENT MAX.

2149
01:34:14,848 --> 01:34:17,284
从来没有一个麦克斯。
THERE NEVER WAS A MAX.

2150
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:19,753
除了伦纳德，没有其他男人。
THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANYONE BUT LEONARD.

2151
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,855
只有伦纳德。
ONLY LEONARD.

2152
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:24,258
哦，我亲爱的。
OH, MY DEAR.

2153
01:34:24,324 --> 01:34:26,393
为什么你不能相信我——
WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE TRUSTED ME--

2154
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,829
真诚地、体面地
WORKED WITH ME TRUTHFULLY?

2155
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:30,864
与我合作吗？
HONORABLY?

2156
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,866
我们可以让他脱罪。
WE WOULD HAVE GOT HIM OFF.

2157
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:35,169
我不能冒这个风险。
I COULD NOT TAKE THAT RISK.

2158
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:39,206
你看，你以为他是无辜的。
YOU SEE, YOU THOUGHT HE WAS INNOCENT.

2159
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:43,544
而且你知道他是无辜的。
AND YOU KNEW HE WAS INNOCENT.

2160
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,711
我明白。
I UNDERSTAND.

2161
01:34:44,778 --> 01:34:46,780
不，威尔弗雷德爵士。
NO, SIR WILFRED.

2162
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,816
你不明白。
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

2163
01:34:48,882 --> 01:34:50,784
我知道他有罪。
I KNEW HE WAS GUILTY.

2164
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:54,655
天啊！
GOOD GOD!

2165
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,825
这不可能是真的。
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

2166
01:34:57,891 --> 01:35:01,328
我祷告上帝希望不是真的
I WISH TO GOD IT WASN'T.

2167
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:05,666
但伦纳德在十点刚过几分钟就回到家了。
BUT LEONARD DID COME HOME A FEW MINUTES PAST 10:00.

2168
01:35:05,732 --> 01:35:08,235
他的袖子上确实有血。
HE DID HAVE BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES.

2169
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,437
他确实告诉我了
AND HE DID TELL ME

2170
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:13,140
他杀了那个女人。
THAT HE HAD KILLED THAT WOMAN.

2171
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,442
他恳求我。
HE PLEADED WITH ME.

2172
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:17,444
我知道...
I KNEW...

2173
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:21,248
只有我才能救他。
ONLY I COULD SAVE HIM.

2174
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,283
你呢 -
AND YOU--

2175
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,353
你确实救了他。
YOU DID SAVE HIM.

2176
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:28,889
一个杀人犯。
A MURDERER.

2177
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:30,390
威尔弗雷德爵士，
AGAIN, SIR WILFRED,

2178
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,593
你不明白。
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

2179
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,763
我爱他。
I LOVE HIM.

2180
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:45,772
我告诉过你她是一名演员。
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS AN ACTRESS.

2181
01:35:45,839 --> 01:35:47,174
而且是一个好演员。
AND A GOOD ONE.

2182
01:35:48,842 --> 01:35:51,145
我知道她会为我做点什么
I KNEW SHE'D DO SOMETHING FOR ME,

2183
01:35:51,211 --> 01:35:52,679
但我就是不知道是什么，
BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT,

2184
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:54,281
或者如何。
OR HOW.

2185
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:55,649
伦纳德，亲爱的。
LEONARD, DARLING.

2186
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:57,851
她彻底骗了你，不是吗？
FOOLED YOU COMPLETELY, DIDN'T SHE?

2187
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,887
不。
NO.

2188
01:35:59,953 --> 01:36:02,856
是你，沃尔……
IT WAS YOU, VOLE...

2189
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:05,692
真的骗了我。
WHO REALLY FOOLED ME.

2190
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:09,796
37 年后...
AFTER 37 YEARS...

2191
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:13,834
如此盲目，
TO BE SO BLIND,

2192
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:17,538
如此愚蠢。
SO STUPID.

2193
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:24,278
放轻松点。
EASY.

2194
01:36:24,344 --> 01:36:25,679
我们都全身而退。
WE BOTH GOT OUT OF IT ALIVE.

2195
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:27,481
最好吃片药。
BETTER TAKE YOUR PILL.

2196
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:30,551
英国仍然有法院。
THERE ARE STILL COURTS IN ENGLAND.

2197
01:36:30,617 --> 01:36:32,586
你的案子还没有结束。
THEY'RE NOT THROUGH WITH YOU YET.

2198
01:36:32,653 --> 01:36:34,555
嗯，当然结束了。你懂的。
WELL, SURE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THAT.

2199
01:36:34,621 --> 01:36:36,423
你做得很棒，威尔弗雷德爵士。
YOU DID TOO GOOD A JOB, SIR WILFRED.

2200
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,759
你让我脱罪。我不会再受审判了。
YOU GOT ME OFF. I CAN'T BE TRIED AGAIN.

2201
01:36:38,825 --> 01:36:39,993
这就是法律。
THAT'S THE LAW.

2202
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,229
以某种方式，
SOMEHOW, IN SOME WAY,

2203
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:44,998
你将为此付出代价。
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

2204
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,333
我同意。
I AGREE.

2205
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,769
首先，我们将您的费用加倍。
LET'S DOUBLE YOUR FEE, TO BEGIN WITH.

2206
01:36:48,835 --> 01:36:52,306
珍妮特·麦肯齐的新助听器怎么样？
AND HOW ABOUT A NEW HEARING AID FOR JANET MacKENZIE?

2207
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:53,707
对于你，我亲爱的，
AND FOR YOU, MY DEAR,

2208
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:56,176
5,000 英镑用于支付伪证罪审判费用。
£5,000 TO PAY FOR YOUR PERJURY TRIAL.

2209
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:57,311
这应该会让你轻松一些。
THAT OUGHT TO GET YOU OFF EASY.

2210
01:36:57,377 --> 01:36:59,613
哦，感谢上帝，一切都结束了。
OH, THANK GOD IT'S OVER.

2211
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,950
我再也不要经历那样的事情了。
I COULD NEVER GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

2212
01:37:03,016 --> 01:37:04,685
但现在——是的。
BUT NOW-- YES.

2213
01:37:04,751 --> 01:37:05,786
你已经回到我身边了。
I'VE GOT YOU BACK.

2214
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:07,254
呃，克里斯汀。
UH, CHRISTINE.

2215
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:08,422
克里斯汀，我认为有一些东西，
CHRISTINE, I THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING,

2216
01:37:08,488 --> 01:37:09,590
真的，我们必须面对，
REALLY, THAT WE HAVE TO FACE,

2217
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:10,924
而且越早越好。
AND THE SOONER THE BETTER.

2218
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,192
什么？ -
WHAT? WELL--

2219
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:13,760
你在说什么？
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

2220
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:15,429
你和我，呃，
YOU AND I, UH,

2221
01:37:15,495 --> 01:37:17,564
我们一直在这里假装——
WE'VE BEEN PRETENDING HERE, ALL ALONG--

2222
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,633
在审判中，我的意思是——对所有人。
IN THE TRIAL, I MEAN--FOR EVERYONE.

2223
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,202
我们不该继续假装
WE DON'T WANT TO PRETEND ANYMORE, NOT TO EACH OTHER.

2224
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,704
我们变了。
WE'VE CHANGED.

2225
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,772
我们不想回到原来的样子。
WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

2226
01:37:25,839 --> 01:37:27,441
但是，伦纳德，我——
BUT, LEONARD, I--

2227
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:29,710
相信我，我绝对不后悔，
BELIEVE ME, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS,

2228
01:37:29,776 --> 01:37:31,845
但一切都结束了。
BUT IT'S OVER.

2229
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:35,515
不。
NO.

2230
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:37,718
我们只有 20 分钟的时间赶上火车，
WE'VE ONLY 20 MINUTES TO CATCH THE BOAT TRAIN,

2231
01:37:37,784 --> 01:37:38,785
威尔弗雷德爵士。
SIR WILFRED.

2232
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:40,354
克里斯汀：（小声）我的天啊。
Christine: ( whispering ) MY GOD.

2233
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:43,957
你不是这个意思。 （呼吸颤抖）
YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT. ( breathing shakily )

2234
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:45,692
你不能离开我。
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

2235
01:37:45,759 --> 01:37:47,394
不是现在。
NOT NOW.

2236
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:49,363
我救了你的命，带你离开德国。
I SAVED YOUR LIFE GETTING YOU OUT OF GERMANY.

2237
01:37:49,429 --> 01:37:51,231
你在这个法庭上救了我的命。
YOU SAVED MY LIFE HERE IN THIS COURTROOM.

2238
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,299
现在我们扯平了，对吧？不。
NOW WE'RE EVEN, RIGHT? NO.

2239
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,800
女人：伦纳德，亲爱的，
Woman: LEONARD, DARLING,

2240
01:37:53,867 --> 01:37:55,702
我们还要在这里呆多久？
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY HERE?

2241
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,704
我很想离开这个地方。
I'M RATHER ANXIOUS TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE.

2242
01:37:57,771 --> 01:38:00,274
（喘息）我们一会儿就离开。
( gasps ) WE'LL BE LEAVING IN A MINUTE.

2243
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:01,708
（呻吟声）
( moans )

2244
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,679
这是为数不多的真实陈述之一。
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW TRUE STATEMENTS THAT WAS MADE.

2245
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:08,248
你看，我们确实在旅行社见过面。
YOU SEE, WE DID MEET AT THE TRAVEL AGENCY.

2246
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:09,416
哦，伦纳德，拜托！
OH, LEONARD, PLEASE!

2247
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:11,418
哦，亲爱的上帝，请听我说！
OH, DEAR GOD, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!

2248
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:12,753
我爱你——不，不，克里斯汀，
I LOVE YOU-- NO, NO, CHRISTINE,

2249
01:38:12,819 --> 01:38:14,388
我们不要让事情变得更糟，
LET'S NOT MAKE IT ANY WORSE,

2250
01:38:14,454 --> 01:38:16,757
否则他们把你当共犯抓起来！
OR THEY MIGHT TRY YOU AS AN ACCESSORY!

2251
01:38:16,823 --> 01:38:18,225
不！你知道这意味着什么！
NO! AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!

2252
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,760
让他们来抓！
LET THEM!

2253
01:38:19,826 --> 01:38:21,395
我不在乎他们做什么。
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO.

2254
01:38:21,461 --> 01:38:23,463
或者如果他们一定要抓我，
OR IF THEY MUST TRY ME,

2255
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:25,232
就当我是杀人犯吧！
LET IT BE FOR MURDER!

2256
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:26,867
（喘气）
( gasps )

2257
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,473
（尖叫声）
( screams )

2258
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,543
（女人尖叫）
( woman screaming )

2259
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,654
（喘气）
( gasps )

2260
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:50,691
（女人尖叫）伦纳德！
( woman screams ) LEONARD!

2261
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:53,627
（抽泣）
( sobs )

2262
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:00,734
（女人继续抽泣）
( woman continues sobbing )

2263
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:06,239
哦！ （抽泣）
OH! ( sobbing )

2264
01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:08,008
不！
NO!

2265
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:12,646
她——她杀了他！
SHE--SHE KILLED HIM!

2266
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:17,984
不。她处死了他。
NO. SHE EXECUTED HIM.

2267
01:39:32,065 --> 01:39:35,569
一个不平常的女人。
A REMARKABLE WOMAN.

2268
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:44,244
最好把行李取回来，
BETTER BRING BACK THE LUGGAGE,

2269
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,480
让车先走吧。
AND YOU CAN DISMISS THE CAR.

2270
01:39:49,282 --> 01:39:50,817
我们现在不出发，
WE WON'T BE LEAVING NOW,

2271
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:52,619
对吗？
WILL WE?

2272
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,492
是的。
NO.

2273
01:40:00,827 --> 01:40:02,462
谢谢你，
THANK YOU,

2274
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:04,664
普利姆索尔小姐。

2275
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:09,569
直接让布罗根摩尔到我的房间。
GET BROGAN-MOORE TO MY CHAMBERS DIRECTLY.

2276
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:12,506
还有梅休。
AND HAVE MAYHEW THERE, TOO.

2277
01:40:12,572 --> 01:40:14,841
我们要为克里斯汀·沃尔
WE'RE APPEARING FOR THE DEFENSE

2278
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:18,378
的审判辩护。
IN THE TRIAL OF CHRISTINE VOLE.

2279
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:21,481
来吧，老头子。
COME ON, OLD MAN.

2280
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,519
威尔弗雷德爵士！
SIR WILFRED!

2281
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:30,524
你忘了带白兰地。
YOU FORGOT YOUR BRANDY.
