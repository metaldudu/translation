我们反对英国广播公司

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,940

案件被撤销了
Case dismissed.

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,950
据说他的经纪人收买了车主

101
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,020
好吧

但相信我

107
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,930
这绝非事实

野林乐团都是干净的好男孩

The sort any girl'd be happy to bring home to meet her parents.

110
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,680
我父母不会乐意我带个偷车贼回家的
I don't think my parents would like me to bring home a car thief.

111
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,420
那完全是场误会
That was a complete misunderstanding.

112
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,760
地方法官也这么认为
The magistrates agreed.

113
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,770
相信我  他们是干净的好男孩
I'm telling you, they're good, clean boys,

114

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,770
-不管怎样  -朗姆酒可乐
- Well, nevertheless... - The odd rum and coke.

116
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,740
野林乐团偶尔会喝点
That's The Wildwood drink, yes.

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,070
但毒品
But drugs?

118
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,000
不会的
No.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
那你认为那大麻是怎么来的
So, how do you explain the marijuana?

120
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,750
我不知道
I can't.

121
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,510
或许是粉丝的
Well, fans maybe?

122
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,900
媒体没事找事
The press trying to make a story?

123
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,420
或是节目组的其他人
Some of these other types from the show.

124
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,550
做电视的人
Television people.

125
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,060
你也知道他们什么样
You know what they're like.

126
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,720
"如果你来牛津  你会死的"

128
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,270
我收到的一些信  你都难以想象
You wouldn't believe some of my correspondence.

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,470
我还会收到下流照片
I get dirty pictures.

130
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
狗屎
Dog mess.

131
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,740
什么都有

是真的
She does.

133
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,310
人们的行为真是野蛮
People carrying on like animals.

134
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,040
是啊
Quite. Quite.

135
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,680
但之前没有这种事  没有直接威胁
But nothing like this before, no direct threat.

136
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,040
总有些人
Well, there are always people

137
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,110
怨恨那些为主行事的人
who resent those going about Our Lord's work.

138
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,710
但你想不到哪个特定的人吗  佩蒂博太太
But nobody specific comes to the mind, Mrs. Pettybon?

139
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,560
有很多人寄过
Well, a lot of people send

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,600
很多不好的东西来  督察
a lot of very unpleasant things, Inspector.

141
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,960
如果我们个个当真
If we took them all seriously...?

142
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,270
你的安全当然是我们的头等要务
Your safety is our paramount concern, of course.

得了  肯  别惹人厌

不  让我来处理  尼克

160
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,270
如果不是陷害  那算什么
So, if it's not a frame-up, what is it?

161
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,820
敲诈吗
A shakedown, is that it?

162
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,430
肯  他没那个意思
Ken, he doesn't mean that.

163
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,960
给他钱就好了  拉弗

谈论贿赂警察

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,490
我或许无法证实大麻是你们的
I may not be able to connect you to this pot,

171
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,750
但这算是非正式警告了

就盯着她点就好
Just keep an eye, that's all.

她也就在这里待一晚
She's only in town overnight.

她正在进行全国巡回演讲

190
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,740
她在收集签名  是吧
She's collecting signatures, isn't she?

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,750
对  是份请愿  她打算交到

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,350
到现在已经有不知多少人的手碰过了
Well, I doubt we'll have much luck after all the hands

198
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,250
所以希望不大  但还是查查指纹吧

你在学院那边怎么样

200
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,040
无法证明他们跟大麻有关
Oh, there was nothing to tie them to the pot,

201
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,910
我只能给他们经纪人下达了非正式警告
so I gave their manager an informal caution

202
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,870
就算完事了
and left it at that.

203
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,500
真不懂他们为何喜欢这玩意
I don't know why they bother with the stuff.

有些小伙子都抽上瘾了

你试过吗

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,360

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,280

约一小时前  店主发现了尸体

她凌晨3点听到了车声

除此之外  没什么不寻常的了

236

大概有我手指粗的绳子
About the thickness of my finger.

237
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,250
或许是吊窗绳
Sash-cord, perhaps?

238
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,070
我没动他  但看死后尸僵
He's as I found him, but postmortem lividity

248
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,830
因为他的鞋吗
State of his boots, you mean?

249
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,150
鞋底有水泥或混凝土

在警局这就是寻常的一晚

这是不行的  太太

273
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,810
作为警察  我必须保持中立
As a police officer I have to remain impartial.

274

但没人能反对这种观点吧
But no one could argue with the sentiment, surely?

275
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,010
显然还是有人反对的

276
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,770
佩戴它可能会被视为拉帮结派

277

佩蒂博太太

抱歉  那里不在我们辖区之内
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm afraid that's beyond our jurisdiction.

290
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,360
警察局长向我保证了
I was assured by the Chief Constable

291

你觉得佩蒂博太太的事是怎么回事

她显然很会
Well, she's clearly got a talent

297
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,510
惹人生气
for rubbing people up the wrong way.

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,110
你真要我去做保姆吗
Look, do you really want me on babysitting duty?

299
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,280
我们在酒馆院子里发现的尸体怎么办

史蒂夫·卡特先生  长官

301
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,870
来报案说他的工人今早没来上班

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,600
看来不是  你是...
It would appear not, Mister...?

463
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,050
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

464
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,610
克里斯托弗·克拉克
Christopher Clark.

465
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,810
斯蒂克斯
Stix.

466
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,910
鼓手
The drummer.

467
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,910
安娜-布丽特  克里斯的...
Anna-Britt, Chris's...

468
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,960
克里斯的妻子
Chris's wife,

469
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,120
但不知为何我们不能告诉别人
only for some reason we're not allowed to tell anyone.

470
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,410
只是生意
It's just business.

471
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,880
歌迷不希望知道他们已经结婚了
The fans don't want to know the boys are married.

472
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,290
你不是给了巴里份工作吗
You offered Barry a job,

473
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,510
是吧  拉弗
didn't you, Ralph?

474
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,650
我...
Well...

475
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,180
没有
No.

476
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,310
没有吗
No?

477
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,300
他似乎是这么认为的
He seemed to think you had.

478
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,400
我是说  如果有机会的话
I'd said, if something came up.

479
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,750
做司机或...
Driving or...

480
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,860
并没说定
It wasn't a firm offer.

481
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,500
他就是有点追星昏头了
He was a bit star-struck, that's all.

482
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,860
他和他的同事之间没什么问题吧
And was everything all right between him and his colleague?

483
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,940
跟卡特先生
Mr. Carter?

484
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,910
就我们所知是没有
As far as we know.

485
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,200
我们跟他们其实没多少瓜葛
Look, we really didn't have much to do with either of them.

486
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,510
巴克希医生
Dr. Bakshi,

487
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,850
他负责照顾团员们
he looks after the boys.

488
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,810
是吗  怎么说
Oh, yes, in what way?

489
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,640
他们是警察
These gentlemen are with the police.

490
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,390
有一位工人
One of the laborers has,

491
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,290
死了
...has died.

492
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,350
这样啊
I see.

493
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,090
回答你们的问题
In answer to your question,

494
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,110
我负责团员们的健康
I tend to the group's well-being--

495
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,560
身体  心理和精神健康
physical, mental and spiritual.

496
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,020
事实上  我跟尼克还约了4点的看诊
As a matter of fact, I have a 4:00 session with Nick,

497
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,530
为他今晚的电视表演做准备
to prepare him for tonight's TV performance.

498
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,050
除非你们有什么意见
Unless you've any objection.

499
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,890
没问题  先生
Very well, sir.

500
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,700
你觉得他走出这里了吗
You think he left here?

501
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,890
你觉得呢
Do you?

502
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,150
他们绝对有问题
They're a rum lot, and no mistake,

503
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,710
那经纪人也是
and I wouldn't trust that manager

504
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,160
完全不可信
so far as I could throw him.

505
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,860
好了
Now.

506
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,370
真有趣
Here's fun.

507
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
去世的巴里·芬奇
The late Barry Finch.

508
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,710
给明星打工的砖瓦匠小工
Brickie's laborer to the stars.

509
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,910
死因
Cause of death.

510
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
勒死
The strangulation?

511
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,130
他是被勒过
He was strangled, yes.

512
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,790
好几次呢
Several times.

513
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,650
但那并非死因
Only that's not what killed him.

514
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,530
不是窒息
It wasn't asphyxia.

515
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,540
而是心脏衰竭
His heart gave out.

516
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,620
勒颈是死亡过程中发生的
The strangulation occurred peri-mortem.

517
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,990
就在死亡时刻前后
On or about the moment of death.

518
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,340
但他本就要死了
He was already dying.

519
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,980
但不会是勒颈导致了他心肌梗塞吗
But couldn't the strangulation have caused the heart seizure?

520
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,870
是可能
Certainly.

521
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,030
当颈部迷走神经突然被施压
When sudden pressure is put on the vagus nerve in the neck,

522
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,610
确实可能造成立即死亡
instantaneous death can happen.

523
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,390
但你瞧  如果我...
But you see if I...

524
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,280
这样  你首先会怎么做
Now... what's the first thing you're going to do?

525
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,290
努力把它弄掉
I'm trying to get it off.

526
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
努力  没错
Ah try, yes.

527
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,470
在这样的情况下  按说该有擦伤
Now a case like this, one would expect to find abrasions--

528
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,750
脖子上应该有抓痕
scratches to the neck--

529
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,900
被害人手指甲里应该有他们自己的皮肉
the victim's own skin and flesh under their fingernails.

530
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,550
但芬奇先生没有
And that's not the case with Mr. Finch?

531
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,540
对
No.

532
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,920
你可以...
Would you...

533
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,180
当然
Oh, yes. Of course.

534
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,890
如果是因为他的手不能动呢
What if his hands weren't free?

535
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,690
并无迹象表明他被绑着
There's nothing to suggest he was bound.

536
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,020
手腕处无磨伤
No chafing to the wrists;

537
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,370
没有淤青表明他遭到了捆绑
no bruises to say he was restrained.

538
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,590
这没道理
It doesn't make sense.

539
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,600
为何要去勒死濒死的人
Why strangle a dying man?

540
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,310
幸好  那是你得琢磨的事
Well, that's your department, thankfully.

541
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,550
我更关心的是  什么东西能让一个健康的
I'm more concerned as to what would stop the heart

542
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,290
24岁男人的心脏停跳
of an otherwise fit 24-year-old.

543
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,300
他的东西在旁边那里
His bits and bobs on the side there.

544
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,920
没什么值得注意的
There's nothing remarkable.

545
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,180
如果不是他杀  为什么会有人想装成他杀
Why would someone want to make it look like murder if it wasn't?

546
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,120
都说不通  是吧
Nothing really adds up, does it?

547
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,420
你在跟踪我们吗
You following us?

548
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,320
不是
No.

549
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,600
我是跟佩蒂博太太来的
I'm here with Mrs. Pettybon.

550
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,000
那个老疯婆子
That batty old woman?

551
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,090
该有人教训她
Someone wants to put her straight.

552
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,450
是有人威胁这么做
Someone's threatened to.

553
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,400
威胁做什么
Threatened to what?

554
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,620
干掉她吗
Do her in?

555
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,670
老天爷  有点过了吧
Blimey, that's a bit much.

556
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,370
她虽然疯疯癫癫
I mean she's mad as a march hare,

557
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,540
但也没人希望她出事
but you wouldn't want anything to happen to her.

558
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,820
蠢婆娘
The silly cow.

559
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,200
喜欢这披风吗
Like the clobber?

560
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,570
所有人都穿这个
Everyone's wearing '.

561
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,700
那么
So'.

562
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,770
谢谢大家  晚上好
Thank you and good evening.

563
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,070
欢迎收看《年鉴》
Welcome to Almanac.

564
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,890
半小时的音乐  闲聊和时事
Half an hour of music, chat and current affairs.

565
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,500
我们今晚的节目相当精彩
And what a show we have for you tonight.

566
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,150
稍后  我们将独家专访
Coming up later, we have an exclusive interview

567
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,140
野林乐团的尼克·威尔丁
with Nick Wilding, of The Wildwood.

568
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,710
冷静  姑娘们
Steady, girls.

569
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,310
他的乐团将表演他们的最新曲目
And his group will be performing their latest sound

570
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,130
《詹妮弗有时》
"Jennifer Sometimes."

571
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,880
他的乐团
His group.

572
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,680
好啊
Nice.

573
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
他的乐团
His group.

574
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,860
但首先  我要对话
But before that, I'm going to be talking to

575
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,180
全国电视整顿协会的领袖
the leader of the National Clean Up Television Society,

576
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,990
保持英国得体活动的标志人物
figurehead of the Keep Britain Decent campaign

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,280
也是英国道德的守护者
and Guardian of the Nation's Morals.

578
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,360
女士们先生们  有请乔伊·佩蒂博太太
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Joy Pettybon'.

579
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,050
谢谢你请我上节目  卡林德先生
Thank you for having me on your program, Mr. Calendar.

580
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,870
不客气
Not at all.

581
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,710
请叫我"朱利安"
And, "Julian," please.

582
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,130
佩蒂博太太
Now, Mrs. Pettybon,

583
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,290
据我所知  您正在进行自己的征程[十字军]
I understand you're on something of a crusade at the moment?

584
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,540
我不会用这样的字眼
I wouldn't put it in those terms,

585
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,620
但  是的  我想我们是在为主行事
but, yes, I suppose what we're doing is the Lord's work.

586
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,130
您在全国上下巡回
You're traveling up and down the country

587
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,500
为一份请愿收集签名  是吗
collecting signatures for a petition, is that right?

588
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,360
是的
We are.

589
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,880
这份请愿的内容是什么
And what's it calling for-- this petition?

590
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,700
其中就包括  让电视和无线电
Well, amongst other things, decency on television,

591
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,510
保持得体
and on the wireless.

592
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,710
我正打算上无线电呢  或者说电台
I was going to come on to the wireless, or the radio,

593
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,130
我们现在都这么叫了
as we tend to call it nowadays.

594
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,900
因为你所声讨的人之一
Because one of the people you've been complaining about--

595
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,160
事实上  你还呼吁
in fact, you've actually called for

596
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,970
电台禁播他的专辑
his record to be banned from the airwaves--

597
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,270
他今晚也在演播室
is in the studio with us tonight.

598
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,590
是吗
Is that right?

599
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,890
是的  当然  我说的就是
That is right, yes-- it is, of course,

600
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,340
流行乐团  野林乐团的尼克·威尔丁
Nick Wilding, of the pop group The Wildwood.

601
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,460
-抬脚  -那么
- Feet up. - Now

602
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,020
你究竟不喜欢他的音乐哪点
what is it you don't like about his music?

603
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,160
并不是音乐的问题
It's not the music, is it?

604
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,410
当然了  那是很吵
Of course it's too loud...

605
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,130
但我反对的是歌词
...but it's the words that I object to.

606
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,090
歌词
The words.

607
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,240
歌词有什么不对
What's wrong with them?

608
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,090
如果非要我明说
Well, if-if you want me to spell it out,

609
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,820
他们现在的这张专辑  是关于性的
this record they have at the minute, it's about S-E-X,

610
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,260
是吧  还有吸毒
isn't it, and drug taking.

611
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,150
好吧
All right, well,

612
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,500
那你稍后可以自己对他提出这些指控
you can put those charges to him yourself in a moment,

613
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,140
但首先  我们听听吧
but first, let's get an earful.

614
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,190
听听这争论的焦点
Hear what all the fuss is about.

615
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,470
有请他们  女士们先生们
Here they are, ladies and gentlemen.

616
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,040
把女儿锁好了

617
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,090
野林乐团带来了他们的新歌《詹妮弗有时》

622
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,980
*詹妮弗有时*

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,040

Since when have you watched Almanac?

625
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,020
是工作
It's work.

626
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,390
什么工作
What work?

627
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,070
佩蒂博太太
Mrs. Pettybon.

628
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,850
摩斯在保卫她

有人威胁她
There've been threats.

630
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,660
我可不意外
I'm not surprised.

631
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,720
对别人的行为指手画脚
Telling people what they should and shouldn't.

632
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,310
"得体"
"Decency."

633
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,620
要我说  她就是喜欢听自己夸夸其谈
She just likes the sound of her own voice, if you ask me.

634
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,890
他们不就是琼喜欢的那个吗
Aren't those the ones that Joan likes?

635
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,830
野林乐团
The Wildwood.

636
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,060
我可不知道
I wouldn't know.

637
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,040
你当然知道
You would.

638
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,090
你去沃尔沃斯替她买了他们的第一张专辑
You fetched their first record for her from Woolworths.

639
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,180
你说是就是吧
If you say so.

640
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,600
怎么  我们都不能提她了吗
What? We're not allowed to talk about her now?

641
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,010
弗莱德
Fred?

642
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,840
有什么好谈的
What's there to talk about?

643
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,460
那不是你的真心话
You don't mean that.

644
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,400
如果她想打电话  早就打了
If she was going to call, she'd have called.

645
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,760
还好吗
All right?

646
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,710
嗯  我...
Yes, I...

647
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,390
妈妈抛头露面时我会紧张
I get nervous when Mummy makes an appearance.

648
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,540
我必须出来喘口气
I have to step out.

649
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,620
这是我的恶习
It's my vice.

650
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,410
恶心的习惯
Filthy habit.

651
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,490
你不必担心
You mustn't worry.

652
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,780
这世上好多疯子呢
The world's full of cranks.

653
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,380
你可能觉得妈妈也有点疯吧
You probably think Mummy's a bit of a crank.

654
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,750
我相信她是...真心的
I'm sure she's... sincere.

655
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,870
是的
She is.

656
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,540
她做了多久...
How long she been...

657
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,960
大概四年了
About four years.

658
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,680
但她是在爸爸过世后才真正投入进来的
But she really got into it after Daddy passed away.

659
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,080
他是个好人
He was a wonderful man.

660
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,700
是吗
Was he?

661
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,940
我们还是回去吧
We should probably go back inside.

662
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,320
是啊
Yes.

663
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,300
你不会告诉她吧
You, you won't tell her?

664
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,390
烟的事
About the cigarette.

665
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,140
不不
No, no, no, no, no.

666

谢谢
Thank you.

667
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,940
这些迹象都表明
These are symptoms of a...

668
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,000
社会缺乏信仰  自甘堕落
of a godless and degenerate society.

669
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,660
上周有个节目
There was this program last week,

670
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,790
简直是我看过的最龌龊的节目
and it was the dirtiest program I have ever seen.

671
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,190
-龌龊[脏]  -确实
- Dirty? - Well, it was.

672
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,110
什么意思
What do you mean?

673
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,300
他们是没洗澡还是怎么
The people in it hadn't had a wash, or what?

674
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,490
你很清楚我什么意思
You know very well what I mean.

675
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,450
我不清楚
I don't.

676
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,780
真的
Honestly.

677
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,300
什么叫"龌龊"
What's "dirty"?

678
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,260
什么叫"龌龊"
What's "dirty"?

679
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,520
龌龊就是龌龊  就是这样
Dirty's dirty. That's what dirty is.

680
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,300
是啊  但你觉得龌龊的
Yeah, but what's dirty to you

681
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,550
别人或许觉得能接受  是吧
might be quite acceptable to somebody else, mightn't it?

682
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,280
甚至很正常
Quite normal, in fact.

683
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,630
这个才不正常
This wasn't normal.

684
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,760
让我感到反胃
It made me physically sick.

685
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
究竟有什么不对
What was wrong with it, then?

686
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,820
是关于两个所谓的同性恋
It was about two of these so-called homosexuals.

687
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,950
什么叫"所谓"
How do you mean "so-called"?

688
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,070
《圣经》里可不是这么说他们的
Well, the Good Book's got quite a different name for them.

689
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,050
是吗
Has it?

690
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,490
那是怎么说的
Well, what's that, then?

691
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,550
鸡奸者
Sodomites.

692
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,180
不论我往哪看
Everywhere I look,

693
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,360
都躲不过这些污秽
I'm having it rammed down my throat.

694
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,910
我可不想它出现在我家客厅
Well, I don't want it in my lounge.

695
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,660
纵容社会
The Permissive Society.

696
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,400
是啊
Yes'.

697
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,780
就是这么说的
That's what they call it.

698
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,520
可没人问我容不容许
Well, nobody asked my permission.

699
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,280
好  说得对
Bravo'. Well said'.

700
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,290
胡说
Rubbish'.

701
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,980
好了  先生
All right, sir.

702
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,870
纯粹胡说
Absolute rubbish'.

703
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,530
不是胡说
It's not rubbish.

704
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,640
抱歉  谁让你说了算了
Sorry. Who put you in charge?

705
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,740
你图个什么
Where do you get off

706
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,330
非要教育我们该看什么
telling us what we can

707
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,530
该听什么
or can't see or hear?

708
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,320
艺术表达的自由呢
What about freedom of artistic expression?

709
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,030
别碰我
Don't-- do not touch me'.

710
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,140
别碰我
Don't touch me'.

711
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,050
我这就走
I'm leaving.

712
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,890
我走
I'm leaving.

713
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,590
好啊
Well,

714
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,670
瞧瞧  女士们先生们
there we are, ladies and gentlemen.

715
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,440
直播放送的欢乐和刺激

716
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
从不会无聊
Never a dull moment.

717
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,250
那么我们还是回到这个问题上来
If we might return now to the matter at hand,

718
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,380
佩蒂博太太  你之前说起龌龊...
Mrs. Pettybon, you were talking about what's dirty...

719
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,870
你找我吗
You wanted to see me?

720
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,360
对
Oh, yeah.

721
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,840
今早有个男人送到前台的
A bloke dropped it off at the front desk this morning.

722
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,940
警长  这个工人的事有进展吗
Oh, Sergeant, any developments on this laborer?

723
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,730
-巴里·芬奇  长官  -是的
- Barry Finch, Sir. - Just so.

724
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,870
我稍后要去见助理警察局长
I'm seeing the Assistant Chief Constable later.

725
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,730
他肯定会问起
He's bound to ask.

726
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,070
没什么可查的  长官
Not been much to go on, sir.

727
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,660
他此前品性优良
A person of previous good character,

728
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,090
曾是圣玛丽的唱诗班成员  直到变声

729
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,130
据我们所知没有敌人  没有犯罪记录
No enemies that we know of, no criminal record.

730
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,300
他尸体上的印痕呢
What about this mark on his body?

731
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,930
我也在琢磨呢  长官
Just trying to figure that out myself, sir.

732
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,270
X标记点

733
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,780

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,090
你也想找打吗
Want some too, do you?

735
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,340
我是警察

736
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,250
我的警察证  识字吗
My warrant card-- if you can read.

737
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,950
我们这是为了孩子
It's the kiddies we're thinking of.

738
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,200
他就是个变态
He's a bloody pervert.

739
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,840
给我走
On your way, go on.

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,940

起来
Let's get you...

743
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,570
来
Come on.

744
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,310
你没事吧
You all right?

745
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,250
没事吧
You okay?

746
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,330
你说呢
Do I look it?'

747
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,540
那女人是个禽兽
The woman's a monster'.

748
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,740
她害我被起诉
She had me prosecuted, didn't she?

749
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,640
怎么说  你是...
How's that, mister...?

750
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
杰赛普
Jessop.

751
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,280
达德利·杰赛普
Dudley Jessop.

752
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,250
我经营...
I run...

753
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,280
我曾经营一本杂志
I ran a magazine.

754
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,630
《精彩时代》

755
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,240
佩蒂博太太不喜欢
Mrs. Pettybon took exception

756
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,630
我们的"男学生"特刊
against our "schoolboys" edition

757
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,970
想告我亵渎上帝
and tried to do me for blasphemy.

758
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,500
我写了篇文章
Oh, I wrote an article

759
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,220
把耶稣和圣彼得写成了情人
that considered Jesus and St. Peter as lovers.

760
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,390
我能理解这可能会让她不高兴
I can see how that might rub her up the wrong way.

761
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,060
那是关于爱的
It was about love.

762
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,190
她管那叫"龌龊"
She said it was "dirty."

763
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,720
爱怎么会是龌龊的
How can love be dirty?

764
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,240
如果不龌龊  你大概是没做对
Well, if it isn't, I expect you're not doing it right.

765
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,010
刚刚还挺顺利
I thought that went well.

766
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,270
除了那一点的不愉快
Apart from that little bit of unpleasantness.

767
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,300
如果能安慰你  你的一些支持者
Well, if it's any consolation, some of your supporters

768
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,360
把他打了个半死
have just beaten the living daylights out of him.

769
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,570
你错了
You're mistaken.

770
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,920
我亲眼所见  佩蒂博太太
I saw it, Mrs. Pettybon.

771
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,290
但你的表现太棒了
But you did ever so well.

772
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,830
是吧  牧师
Didn't she, Reverend?

773
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,610
当然
Oh, yes.

774
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,190
非常棒
Yes, marvelously well.

775
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,340
祝福者送来的
Well-wishers.

776
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,510
花和...应该是巧克力
Flowers and chocolates, I believe.

777
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,650
都先拿回酒店去吧  莫温
Just take it all back to the hotel for now, Mervyn.

778
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,290
我们早上把它们送给患病有需要的人
We'll dispense them to the sick and needy in the morning.

779
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,470
那我...
Well, I'll...

780
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,470
你肯定累了
You must be tired.

781
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,570
那我道晚安了
I'll say good night.

782
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,740
晚安  莫温
Good night, Mervyn.

783
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,910
如果没别的事
If there's nothing else.

784
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,980
你今天帮了大忙  警员
You saved, Constable.

785
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,320
恐怕是没干什么有用的事
More squandered, I'm afraid.

786
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,740
外面会有巡警站岗
There'll be a uniform officer outside,

787
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,850
您应该可以安睡
should help you to sleep safely

788
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,580
不必再担心什么了
without any further worries to trouble you.

789
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,140
摩斯先生
Mr. Morse?

790
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,330
我...
I...

791
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,530
不知能不能请你
I... I don't suppose I could ask you

792
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,690
替我开窗
to open my window for me,

793
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,580
可以吗
could I?

794
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,120
不知为何卡住了
It... it sticks somewhat,

795
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,780
昨晚好热
and it was so hot last night.

796
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,820
没问题
Yes.

797
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,180
谢谢
Thank you.

798
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,510
就是有点僵
Just a little stiff, that's all.

799
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,540
你想来杯酒吗
Would... would you care for a drink?

800
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,260
今天挺累的了
Oh, it's been quite a long day.

801
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,310
当然了
Of course.

802
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,610
抱歉
I'm sorry.

803
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,070
不不
No, no, I...

804
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,220
喝一杯应该也没什么的
I'm sure one drink wouldn't do any harm.

805
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,050
但已经过12点了
Though it has gone 12:00.

806
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,740
酒吧肯定早关门了
I doubt the bar will still be open.

807
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,890
我有一瓶酒
I... I've got a bottle.

808
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,580
如果你不介意伏特加
If you don't mind vodka.

809
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,110
玻璃水瓶旁边有个水杯
And there's a glass for water by the carafe.

810
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,490
我可以拿浴室的漱口杯
And I can get a tooth glass from the bathroom.

811
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,160
那会有薄荷味吧
Won't that be a bit minty?

812
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,980
我不介意
Oh, I don't mind minty.

813
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,280
*詹妮弗有时  坐在太阳下*
*Jennifer Sometimes, sits in the sunshine*

814
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,970
*摆弄她的头发*
*Playing with her hair*

815
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,330
*回到旧学校*
*Back in the old school*

816
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,700
*看一颗毒蘑菇下面*
*Look under a toadstool*

817
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,470
*那里并没人*
*There's nobody there.*

818
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,040
谢谢你
Thank you.

819
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,590
照顾妈妈
For looking after Mummy.

820
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,550
不客气
Not a problem.

821
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,340
这样的案子  小心胜过后悔
Cases like this, I think it's better to be safe than sorry.

822
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,050
我不知道她会怎么说我
I don't know what she'd say at me

823
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,970
在房间里招待陌生男人
having a strange man in my room.

824
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,010
我可不想给你惹麻烦
I'd hate to be the cause of any difficulty.

825
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,900
事实上  我还是走吧
In fact, I should probably go.

826
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,220
再喝一杯吧
Have another.

827
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,610
拜托
Please.

828
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,150
我没怎么有机会跟人说话
I don't get to speak to many people

829
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,810
平时只有妈妈和格莱特利牧师
besides Mummy and Reverend Golightly.

830
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,420
我耽搁你去见谁了吗
Am I keeping you from someone?

831
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,130
-你妻子...  -没有
- Your, your wife... - No.

832
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,250
-或未婚妻  -没有
- Or fiancée... - No.

833
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,540
我公寓里等着我的只有瓦格纳
The only thing I have waiting for me at my flat is Wagner.

834
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,330
那好悲哀
Well, that's sad.

835
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,100
还有更糟的事呢
There are worse things.

836
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,080
有吗
Are there?

837
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,290
我想不到
I can't think of any.

838
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,590
我清楚孤独的滋味
I know what it's like to be lonely.

839
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,260
我不孤独
I'm not.

840
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,760
没特别孤独
Particularly.

841
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,460
是吗
Really?

842
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,270
你看上去很孤独
You seem lonely.

843
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,000
上帝饶恕我
God forgive me.

844
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,670
上帝饶恕我
God forgive me.

845
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,097
可怜的格莱特利牧师
Poor Reverend Golightly.

846
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,055
他特别喜欢甜食
He had such a sweet tooth.

847
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,719
但我从没觉得这有什么
Didn't seem any harm in it.

848
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,729
他一向那么帮忙
He was always so helpful.

849
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,562
我不想为此小题大做
I just didn't like to make a fuss.

850
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,194
是否有办法查明  巧克力是谁送的
Is there any way to find out who donated the chocolates?

851
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,729
人们会把这些礼物留在舞台
People just leave them on the stage

852
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,239
或送去我化妆间
or send them to my dressing room.

853
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,649
我们并不做记录
We don't keep a register.

854
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,408
你觉得...
What, you think...

855
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,819
那是给妈妈的吗
You think they were meant for Mummy?

856
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,613
很可能  小姐
It's possible, miss.

857
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,032
昨晚在《年鉴》节目上
There was a disturbance

858
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,872
发生了一点小骚动
at the Almanac program last night.

859
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,287
因为一个叫达德利·杰赛普的人
A man called Dudley Jessop.

860
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,626
他是个堕落之人
He's a degenerate.

861
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,008
你企图让他以亵渎上帝罪被起诉  是吗
You tried to have him prosecuted for blasphemy, is that right?

862
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,636
总得有人为主说话
Someone had to stand up for Our Lord.

863
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,723
(sniffles)

864
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:40,190
(music continues)

865
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,989
没发生什么
Nothing happened.

866
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,239
他离开了
He left.

867
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,657
他离开了  然后死了
He left, and he died.

868
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,245
(music continues)

869
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,918
(gate creaking)

870
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,298
? Jennifer sometimes,
sits in the sunshine ?

871
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,083
(knock at door)

872
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,094
? Back in the old school,
look under a toad stool ?

873
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,600
? There's nobody there ?

874
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,141
对不起
I'm sorry.

875
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,395
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

876
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,898
你不该来这里
You shouldn't be here.

877
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,400
我必须见你
I had to see you.

878
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,647
进来吧
Come in.

879
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,315
谢谢
Thank you.

880
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,280
? Jennifer sometimes ?

881
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,534
不听瓦格纳吗
What happened to Wagner?

882
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,866
是为了工作
It's for work.

883
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,406
抱歉  你有酒吗
I'm sorry, do you have anything to drink?

884
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:42,703
? Jennifer sometimes ?

885
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,213
(record stops)

886
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,251
妈妈发现我拿了两个杯子
Mummy found I had two glasses out.

887
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,420
她
She...

888
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,634
她逼我告诉她  你进过我的房间
She forced me to tell her you'd been in my room.

889
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,888
你惹麻烦了吗
Are you in trouble?

890
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,641
妈妈
...Mummy.

891
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,352
还有这一切
And all of it.

892
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,609
(dog barking outside)

893
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,114
我爱你
I love you.

894
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,119
这就是我来说的
That's what I really came to say is...

895
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,203
我爱你
I love you.

896
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,913
佩蒂博小姐
Miss Pettybon...

897
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,169
叫我贝蒂娜
Bettina.

898
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,415
天啊  你有别人了  是吗
Oh God, there's someone else, isn't there?

899
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,674
(sniffles)

900
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,478
(birds chirping)

901
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,519
"我扑倒在祈祷椅前
"I cast myself down upon the prie-dieu,

902
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,655
大声向天父敞开心扉
"And while aloud I open my heart to the Eternal,

903
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,363
罗兰的残忍行为进一步加剧了
"Roland in a still crueler manner intensifies...

904
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,698
我把后面暴露给他
"Upon the hindquarters I expose to him,

905
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,364
任他发泄恼火和折磨"
his vexations and his torments.""

906
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,078
又见了
Hello again..

907
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,708
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

908
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,959
还以为你不会再来找我们了
I'd thought you were done with us.

909
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,960
还没完事呢
No, not quite.

910
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:07,961
我在找斯潘德先生
I'm actually looking for Mr. Spender

911
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,042
和其他团员
and the rest of the group.

912
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,252
去伦敦了
Gone to London.

913
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,836
拍照
For a photo-session.

914
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,717
之后好像还有电台节目
I think some radio thing later.

915
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,424
但尼克在
Nick's here, though.

916
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,259
他怎么没跟其他团员一起走
Why didn't he go with the rest of the group?

917
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,798
他好像不想去
Don't think he felt up to it.

918
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,057
他在哪
Well, where will I find him?

919
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,764
秘密
It's a secret.

920
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,018
在他的冥思地
In his thinking spot.

921
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,929
他会去那里创作歌曲
He goes there to work on songs.

922
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,724
我真的想找他谈谈
Well, I really would like to talk to him.

923
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,438
麻烦你告诉我那是在哪
If you could tell me where that is.

924
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,022
你找不到的
You won't find it.

925
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,152
为什么
Why not?

926
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,359
因为那是个魔法之地
Because it's an enchanted place.

927
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,070
如果你想我可以带你去
I can show you if you like.

928
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,480
你说你跟乐团在一起几个月了
So you said you've been with the group for a couple of months.

929
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,090
-是吗  -是乐队
- Is that right? - Band.

930
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,100
尼克更喜欢叫"乐队"不是"乐团"
Nick prefers "band" to "group."

931
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,290
是吗
Does he?

932
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,840
你怎么会跟他在一起的
How was it you came to be with them?

933
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,260
就是那样
Just did.

934

I showed it to them.

1074

1076
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,990
还有密封的边沿上
On the sealed flap.

1077
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,690
那是我拆信时沾上的
Yes, well, I would have done that taking the letter out.

1078
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,890
不太可能
Unlikely.

1079
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,100

都是指甲对着信封内侧
with our fingernails facing inside the envelope.

1081
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,630

是不太可能  但不是全无可能

我拿过它很多次
I handled it a lot.

1084
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,700
这我也考虑过
Yes, I thought about that.

1085
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,480
但有一个地方  你是不可能
However, there is one place where it would have been impossible

1086
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,650
留下拇指指纹的
for you to leave your thumbprint.

1087
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,320
邮票下面
Under the stamp.

1088
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,170
我们非常小心才提取到
We had to lift it off very carefully,

1089
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,540
但邮票上有一小块
but there's one small part of that stamp

1090
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,310
胶水没粘牢
where the adhesive didn't quite take.

1091
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,660
在那里  我们找到了清晰的部分指纹
And that's where we found a good partial print

1092
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,400
是你右拇指的
of your right thumb.

1093
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,250
那是不可能的
You see, that would be impossible.

1094
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,760
你的指纹怎么会
How could your fingerprint

1095
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,270
在一个陌生人寄给你的信的
be underneath a stamp on a letter sent to you

1096
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,740
邮票下面
by a complete stranger?

1097
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,220
我告诉你我怎么想吧
I'll tell you what I think, shall I?

1098
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,450
我想  那信是你自己寄给自己的
I think you posted that letter to yourself

1099
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,500
目的是为自己博取同情
in an effort to gain sympathy for your cause

1100
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,210
好获得更多影响力
and drum up trade.

1101
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,110
你无法证明
You can't prove that.

1102
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,810
我们能的  如果我们真努努力
Oh, I expect we can, if we really put our mind to it.

1103
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,480
是这样吗
So let me get this straight.

1104
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,780
克里斯托弗·克拉克的妻子
Christopher Clark's wife

1105
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,030
听到有车离开枫芯堂
heard a car pulling out of Maplewick

1106
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,270
当时是巴里·芬奇死的那晚的凌晨时分
in the early hours on the night Barry Finch died.

1107
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,760
不是有邻居听到
There was a neighbor heard a car

1108
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,140
有车停在过酒馆院子外吗
outside the pub yard, wasn't there?

1109
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,960
或许是斯潘德把他的尸体丢在了那里
Maybe it was Spender dumped his body there.

1110
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,050
斯潘德先生说他当时在伦敦  是吧
Mr. Spender said he was in London, didn't he?

1111
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,760
他在芒特街的公寓
His flat in Mount Street.

1112
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,370
跟美国人通话  你问过他了吗
Talking to America. You press him on that?

1113
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,340
没  他跟尼克之外的其他乐队成员
No, he's with the rest of the band-- apart from Nick--

1114
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,640
去做什么录音了
at some recording session.

1115
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,790
你觉得他说的是实话吗
Think he's on the level?

1116
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,850
尼克吗
Nick?

1117
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,180
我觉得他  艾玛
I think there's something going on

1118
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,860
和皮帕之间有什么
between him, Emma and Pippa.

1119
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,070
他在隐瞒什么事
He's hiding something.

1120
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,730

他之前就在这里
This is where he was earlier.

1134

发现什么了吗
Anything?

1135
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,760
没有
No.

1136
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,000
那是什么
The hell's that?

1137
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,810
那边有什么
Somewhere over there.

-尼克  -尼克  是我

1146
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,670
-尼克  伙计  -尼克哥们
- Nick, mate. - Nicky-boy?

1147
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,450
-是我们  没事的  -你怎么了
- It's us. It's all right. - What's up, man?

1148
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,160
退后一点  退后
Stand back a little. Stand back. Stand back.

1149
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,080
尼克  伙计  他怎么不说话
Nick, mate, why is he not saying anything?

1150
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,980
给他点地方
Just give him some space.

1151
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,660
你把他怎么了
What've you done to him?

1152
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,690
好了
There we go.

1153
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,130
没事了
It's all right, now.

1154
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,670
我就照照你的眼睛
I'm just going to shine a little light into your eyes.

1155
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,290
不会疼的
It's not going to hurt.

1156
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,000
他是怎么了
What's the bloody matter with him?

1157
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,100
他是我弟弟  你想想办法
Well, look, he's my brother, do something'.

1158
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,110
看着我
Look at me.

1159
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,030
他就是嗑嗨了而已
He's high, man. He's just high.

1160
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,870
你冷静点  他没事
You need to stay cool. He's okay.

1161
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,410
他只是嗑药了  他会清醒过来的
He's just on a trip and he's gonna come back down.

1162
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,590
那可不是致幻蘑菇
That's not mushrooms.

1163
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,760
他不会嗑别的
He wouldn't do anything else.

1164
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,710
他不会嗑那些化学品
He wouldn't do any chemicals.

1165
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,670
你们哪个混蛋给他下药了
I mean which one of you bastards dosed him?'.

1166
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,570
他现在最需要的  是平静的环境
The main thing he needs is a calm environment,

1167
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,360
一间安静较黑的房间  还得有人陪着他
a quiet and darkened room, and someone to stay with him.

1168
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,050
我陪着他
I'll stay with him.

1169
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:52,710
不  我陪着他
No. I'll do it.

1170
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,220
-肯  -你做得够多了
- Ken'. - You've done enough, all right?

1171
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,310
我走时他还好好的  我回来时他就...
I left and he was fine, and I come back he's...

1172
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,720
他就疯疯癫癫的了
he's gone half out of his mind.

1173
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,240
你们俩都离远点
So just stay away, the pair of you.

1174
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,110
我又没做什么
I didn't do anything'.

1175
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,580
我们会确保他得到妥善照顾的  肯
We'll make sure he's looked after, Ken.

1176
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,840
你少来
You'll do nothing.

1177
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,530
只有我  克里斯和李
The only people allowed anywhere near him are me,

1178
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,990
可以靠近他
Chris and Lee, all right?

1179
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,960
-我们轮班  -没问题
- We're doing shifts. - You got it, man.

1180
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,530
什么都行  肯
Anything, Ken, all right.

1181
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,400
你的角色是什么  巴克希医生
What's your role in this, Dr. Bakshi?

1182
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,820
我的角色
My role?

1183
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,380
我是斯潘德先生请来的
I was engaged by Mr. Spender

1184
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,530
作为乐团的私人医生
as personal physician to the group.

1185
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,950
那具体都做些什么
And what does that entail, exactly?

1186
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,600
一群健康的小伙子
I wouldn't have thought a bunch of fit young men

1187
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,540
应该不怎么需要一位私人医生
would have much need for a personal doctor.

1188
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,910
你是想不到
Oh, you'd be surprised.

1189
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,760
扭伤  神经衰弱
Sprains, nervous exhaustion...

1190
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,300
巡演乐团必须保持最佳状态
A group on the road needs to be kept in tip-top condition.

1191
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,820
你怎么做
How do you go about that?

1192
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,060
靠药物吗
Pills, is it?

1193
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,610
兴奋剂  安眠药
Uppers? Downers?

1194
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,310
没有违法的东西
Nothing illegal.

1195
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,740
但是的  偶尔开些安眠药
But yes, the occasional sleeping draught.

1196
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:45,930
或兴奋类药物
The odd booster.

1197
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,300
那他是服了什么
Right, so what's he taken here?

1198
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,550
不是我给的东西
Nothing of mine.

1199
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,930
我的诊断是  他被下了大剂量的
My diagnosis is he has been given a large dose

1200
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,050
麦角酸酰二乙氨[LSD迷幻药]
of lysergic acid diethylamide.

1201
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,420
他能恢复吗
And will he recover?

1202
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,420
他的身体没问题
Oh, his body, yes.

1203
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,660
但他的头脑
But his mind?

1204
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,670
那真的要看剂量大小了
It really depends on the size of the dose.

1205
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,890
斯潘德先生
Mr. Spender,

1206
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,090
问几个问题
a few questions, please.

1207
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,630
你是否知道
Have you any idea

1208
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,470
尼克可能从哪得到的迷幻药
where Nick might have come by this LSD?

1209
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,190
他们抽点大麻
They smoke a little pot,

1210
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,280
好吗
all right?

1211
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,820
或许还有致幻蘑菇  但没别的了
Mushrooms maybe, but that's it,

1212
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,930
到此为止了
that's as far as it goes.

1213
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,390
不会嗑什么厉害的
Nothing heavy.

1214
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,830
巴克希医生说  他可能无法痊愈
Dr. Bakshi said he might not fully recover.

1215
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,580
至少是他的神智
His wits, at any rate.

1216
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,460
这对你希望乐团实现的收入目标会是个打击
It's gonna hit any revenue you were hoping to make from the group.

1217
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,290
天啊  重要的不是钱
God, it's not about the money.

1218
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,900
对我不是
Not for me.

1219
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,590
是音乐
It been the music.

1220
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,060
一直都是  从我认识他们就是这样
Always. From the second I saw them.

1221
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,040
那乐团内的不和呢
What about infighting, within the group?

1222
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,220
有人给他下药吗  不会的
Someone dosed him? No. No.

1223
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,830
他们是有争吵  但他们是一家人
I mean they fight, sure, but they're family.

1224
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,010
没人会伤害尼克的
Nobody would hurt Nick.

1225
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,500
好  那乐团外部的人呢
Okay, then what about somebody outside the group?

1226
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,460
那些女孩
One of the girls maybe?

1227
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,810
不  大家都爱尼克
No, everybody loves Nicky.

1228
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,240
克拉克太太说她听到有车
Mrs. Clark said she heard a car

1229
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,610
在巴里·芬奇死的那晚的凌晨时分
pull up outside the house in the early hours,

1230
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,750
停在了房子外面
on the day we found Barry Finch.

1231
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,120
安娜-布丽特只是在搞事
Anna-Britt's just stirring.

1232
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,390
她为什么要那么做
Why would she do that?

1233
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:18,040
她认为我欠了尼克署名权
She thinks I did Chris out of some credit

1234
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,390
是他们的一首歌
on one of the boys' songs,

1235
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,430
《他爱你》  他们的第一首上榜曲
"He Loves You," Their first 45.

1236
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,080
你有吗
Did you?

1237
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,160
没有
No.

1238
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,470
克里斯有天在
Chris was just playing around

1239
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,330
彩排的时候乱拨弄弦
with chord changes in rehearsal, one day.

1240
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,840
激发了尼克的灵感  第二天他就带着
It fired something up in Nicky, he comes in the next day

1241
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,810
《他爱你》来了

1242
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,120
安娜-布丽特认为克里斯该有署名权
Anna-Britt thinks Chris needs credit for that.

1243
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,030
但版权归属很明确
But copyright is very clear.

1244
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,520
所以你那晚没从伦敦回来吗
So you didn't come back from London the other night?

1245
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,730
我说了
I've told you.

1246
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,380
我那晚在我芒特街的公寓
I was in my flat in Mount Street.

1247
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,890
在跟美国那边通电话
On the phone to America.

1248
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,130
那你不会介意我们
Well, then you'll have no objection

1249
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,320
检查你的车了
to us examining your car?

1250
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,500
为什么
What for?

1251
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,370
请便
Help yourself.

1252
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,880
我无可隐瞒
I've got nothing to hide.

1253
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,890
好吧
Well...

1254
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,650
我认为是完美匹配
I'd say that's a perfect match.

1255
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,040
但光靠这个可不足以证明
Tough to make it stick on that alone.

1256
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,900
牛津一半的车里都有十字扳手
Half the cars in Oxford must carry a wheel brace.

1257
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,860
迷幻药能让他心脏停跳吗
Could LSD have stopped his heart?

1258
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,680
是可能的
Well, it's possible.

1259
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,470
过度刺激神经系统
Overstimulation of the nervous system?

1260
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,190
罕见
Rare.

1261
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,860
但有可能
But it could have done.

1262
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,470
它有什么作用
What's it do?

1263
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,610
会制造高强度的
It produces extreme visual

1264
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,960
幻象和幻音
and auditory hallucinations.

1265
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,380
化学上讲  一般无毒
Not usually toxic chemically,

1266
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,060
但从行为上讲...
but behaviorally...?

1267
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,180
怎么说
In what way?

1268
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,790
丧失克制力
Loss of inhibition.

1269
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,920
让人失去理智
Compromised rationality.

1270
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,230
大部分与这种物质有关的死亡都是意外
Most deaths involving the substance are accidental.

1271
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,350
走进车流中
Walking into traffic.

1272
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,850
或是铁轨上
Onto railway lines.

1273
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,710
从高楼坠下
Stepping off high buildings.

1274
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,430
我去找实验室
I'll talk to the lab.

1275
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,340
如果知道该找什么就好找了
Easier to find something if you know what you're looking for.

1276
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,430
她好慈祥
She looks kind.

1277
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,700
她是个慈祥的人吗
Is she kind?

1278
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,950
是的
She was.

1279
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,870
她过世了
She died.

1280
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,370
失去爱的人好难受
It's hard losing someone you love.

1281
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,480
我认为我爱爸爸远胜于我爱她
I think I loved Daddy much more than I love her.

1282
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,420
我尽量去一样地爱她了  但是
I try to love her the same, but...

1283
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,140
我很坏吧
I'm wicked, aren't I?

1284
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,000
-不  -我觉得我坏
- No. - I think I am.

1285
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,350
上帝看到一切
God sees all.

1286
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,920
他清楚我心里有什么
He knows what's in my heart.

1287
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,640
你觉得我会下地狱吗
Do you think I'm going to burn?

1288
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,660
永远业火焚身
In hell forever and ever?

1289
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,090
-不会的  -有时我希望她死了
- No. - Sometimes I wish she was dead.

1290
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,330
我希望她死了  有人来带我
I wish she was dead and that someone would come

1291
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,210
离开上帝
and take me away from God and...

1292
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,080
所以  是的
So, yes.

1293
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,250
可以说  我恨乔伊·佩蒂博
It would be fair to say I pretty much hate Joy Pettybon.

1294
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,840
足以对此采取行动吗
Enough to do something about it?

1295
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,540
我是采取行动了
I am doing something about it.

1296
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,730
我用我仅有的钱
With what little money I do have,

1297
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,460
跟着她的步伐走遍全国
I follow her around the country

1298
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,200
尽我所能戳穿她的真面目
and do my best to denounce her for what she is.

1299
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,940
那是什么
What's that?

1300
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,070
伪君子
A hypocrite'.

1301
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,670
她站在她的演讲台上
She stands on her soapbox

1302
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,160
戴着巫婆帽  和赫达·霍普的眼镜
in that Harridan hat and those Hedda Hopper glasses--

1303
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,160
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}一个转型娱乐记者的好莱坞女星

1304
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,120
这女人显然是不了解什么叫着装打扮
I mean, the woman clearly wouldn't know couture from a dog turd--

1305
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,020
她就站在那里
and she stands there,

1306
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,640
那个比比划划的牧师  在旁怂恿她
with that pantomime horse of a vicar egging her on,

1307
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,660
她满嘴的愤怒和仇恨
spouting bile and hatred...

1308
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,990
她还好意思自称基督徒
and she has the brass neck to call herself a Christian?

1309
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,190
你还做什么别的了吗
And what about doing anything else about it?

1310
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,230
怎么说
In what way?

1311
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,120
昨晚有人企图杀了她
Someone tried to kill her last night.

1312
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:36,680
不
No.

1313
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:38,990
不不不
No, no, no, no.

1314
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,510
我支持的是抗议
I'm all for protest.

1315
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,540
和平抗议
Peaceful protest.

1316
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,860
她没事吧
Is she all right?

1317
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,600
她是没事
She's all right, sir, yes.

1318
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,400
但更多是因为走运
More by luck than anything else.

1319
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,390
但格莱特利牧师今早被发现身亡
But the Reverend Golightly was found dead this morning.

1320
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,440
似乎是被下毒了
It appears he's been poisoned.

1321
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,590
你们不会以为
You can't think...

1322
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,800
这跟我无关
It was nothing to do with me.

1323
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,840
我对上帝发誓
I swear to God.

1324
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,430
是啊  先生  现在对上帝发誓的不少呢
Yes, sir, there's a lot of that going about at the minute.

1325
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,300
但我想请你去趟警局  给你宣读权利后
However, I think we might get a formal statement from you

1326
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,810
做份正式口供
under caution down the station.

1327
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,220
可以跟我们走一趟吗
If you'd like to come with us.

1328
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,980
贝蒂娜  你来吗
Bettina, are you coming?

1329
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,470
马上来  妈妈
In a minute, Mummy.

1330
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,720
这个杰赛普  嫌疑大吗
Likely suspect, this Jessop character?

1331
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,900
至少很可能  长官
Gotta be favorite, sir.

1332
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,810
他非常仇视佩蒂博太太
He hates Mrs. Pettybon with a passion.

1333
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,310
他们昨晚在全国直播电视节目上大吵
They clashed live on national television last night.

1334
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,640
你的假设是
You're proceeding on the assumption

1335
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,210
她才是真正的目标
she was the intended victim.

1336
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,230
暂时是的  长官
Well, for now, sir, yes.

1337
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,740
我们并无理由认为不是
We've no reason to think anything else.

1338
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,420
我们对格莱特利牧师有何了解
What do we know about the Reverend Golightly?

1339
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,910
没有家人  战前成为了牧师
Well, no family, ordained before the war,

1340
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,410
在全国各地都任过职
ministered all over the country.

1341
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,980
跟牛津有任何联系吗
Any connection with Oxford?

1342
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,200
10年前曾短暂在圣玛丽任职
Brief spell as vicar of Saint Mary's, ten years ago.

1343
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,320
圣玛丽
Saint Mary's.

1344
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,800
巴里·芬奇曾是那里的唱诗班成员  直到变声
Barry Finch was a choirboy there, until his voice went.

1345
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,600
看看芬奇尸体上的印记
Looking at the mark on Finch's body.

1346
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,820
如果稍稍转动
If you were to rotate it,

1347
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,080
可能是个十字架  是吧
it could be a cross, couldn't it?

1348
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,760
两个杯子
Two glasses'.

1349
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,570
拜托  妈妈
Please, Mummy.

1350
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,830
什么都没发生
Nothing happened.

1351
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,490
我们只是谈了会儿
We just talked.

1352
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,310
你指望我相信吗
Do you expect me to believe that?

1353
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,190
我清楚男人和女人
I know what goes on in bedrooms

1354
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,460
在卧室里做什么
between men and women.

1355
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,470
妈妈  求你  不要
Mummy, Mummy, please don't.

1356
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,040
这是为了你好  贝蒂娜
It's for your own good, Bettina.

1357
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,560
你一点也不善良
You're not kind'.

1358
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:36,800
你好坏
You're wicked'.

1359
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,030
不虔诚
And Godless'.

1360
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,640
怪不得爸爸...
No wonder Daddy did...

1361
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,200
牛津警局  有什么可以帮您的
Oxford Police Station, how may I help you?

1362
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,940
喂
Hello? Hello?

1363
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,660
请给我接警察局长
Would you put me through to the Chief Constable, please.

1364
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,830
请问您是谁
Yes, who's calling, please?

1365
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,610
我是佩蒂博太太  亲爱的
It's Mrs. Pettybon, dear.

1366
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,070
清空你的一切思绪
Clear your mind of all things.

1367
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:06,880
放下一切世间牵绊
Let go of all earthly attachments.

1368
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:11,440
成为河里的一片叶子
Become a leaf on a river.

1369
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:18,130
你在向下游漂流  漂向虚无
You are drifting downstream towards nothingness.

1370
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,160
可能感觉像死亡
It may feel like death,

1371
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,820
但那并非死去
but it is not dying.

1372
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:40,410
进
Yes.

1373
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,350
长官
Sir?

1374
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,810
我刚跟警部通了电话
I've just got off the telephone from Division.

1375
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,890
看来警察局长
It seems the Chief Constable

1376
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,910
对佩蒂博太太的工作相当敬佩
is a great admirer of Mrs. Pettybon's work.

1377
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,000
她有个女儿  叫贝蒂娜  是吧
She has a daughter. Bettina, is it?

1378
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,940
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1379
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,610
怯生生的小姑娘
Timid little thing.

1380
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,080
是啊  佩蒂博太太认为
Yes, well, Mrs. Pettybon's of the impression

1381
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,910
摩斯似乎跟她有不得体的
Morse may have overstepped the mark somewhat

1382
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,240
行为
in that regard.

1383
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,440
肯定是一派胡言  但警察局长
Nonsense, I'm sure, but the Chief Constable

1384
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,670
要求他不要再参与
wants him removed from any further involvement

1385
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,110
格莱特利案了
in the Golightly case.

1386
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,950
对  她叫我进屋去开个窗
Yes, she asked me in to open the window.

1387
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,520
窗卡住了
It had stuck.

1388
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,050
所以你开了窗户就走了吗
So you just opened her window and went on your way.

1389
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,180
怎么
What?

1390
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,230
我们喝了一杯
Well, we had a drink.

1391
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:41,720
在酒吧吗
In the bar?

1392
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:44,200
她有瓶酒
She had a bottle.

1393
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,310
我在那里待了半小时
I was there for half an hour,

1394
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,710
至多45分钟
45 minutes most.

1395
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,930
你在执勤  你根本不该逗留
You were on duty-- you shouldn't have been there at all.

1396
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:51,750
这下你被批评了
Now you've been handed the black spot,

1397
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,550
还是从最上头来的批评
straight from the top'.

1398
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,930
你觉得这让我多难堪
Where d'you think that leaves me?

1399
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,520
布莱特先生要你撤出格莱特利案
Mr. Bright wants you off the Golightly case.

1400
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,190
你最好把你的脑瓜
Well, you'd better turn that brain of yours

1401
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,740
拿去破巴里·芬奇的案子
back onto Barry Finch.

1402
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,920
查出结果来  布莱特先生就又会赞赏你了
Get a result, you'll be back into Mr. Bright's good books.

1403
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,740
他心里是为你好的
He does have your best interests at heart.

1404
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,550
那他真会掩饰
Hides it well.

1405
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,830
那是因为他比你以为的
That's because he's a lot smarter

1406
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,380
要聪明多了
than you give him credit for.

1407
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:23,730
你别抽了吧
Why don't you lay off that?

1408
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,480
稍稍保持会儿头脑清醒
Keep a clear head for a bit?

1409
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,280
一切都会没事的
Look. It's all gonna be all right.

1410
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,440
是吗
Is it?

1411
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:50,910
你是我弟弟
You're my little brother.

1412
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,580
我绝不会允许你出事的
I'd never let anything happen to you.

1413
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,110
怎么  也开始赶时髦了
What's this? Are you joining the in crowd?

1414
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,980
我觉得我对野林乐团已经无所不知了
I think I know all I need to know about the Wildwood.

1415
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,400
听听
Listen to this.

1416
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,430
"有时  克里斯托弗会创作一段贝斯乐段
"Sometimes Christopher will come up with a bass riff

1417
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,950
激起我的灵感
"That really fires me up.

1418
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,400
大家都会为音乐出力
"We all contribute to the arrangements,

1419
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,000
但克里斯托弗有时会想出
"But Christopher sometimes has an idea

1420
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,860
能让一首歌脱胎换骨的点子"
that totally transforms a song."

1421
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:33,470
话都说不好
Drivel.

1422
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,460
他们也不会那么糟吧
Well, they can't be that awful.

1423
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,010
他们把尼克的歌词跟詹姆斯·乔伊斯
They're comparing Nick's lyrics

1424
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,690
和奥斯卡·王尔德这种名作家比呢
to James Joyce and Oscar Wilde.

1425
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:40,390
谁啊
Who are?

1426
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,360
评论家
The critics.

1427
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,400
据说有很多象征和隐喻
They're full of symbolism and allusion apparently.

1428
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,320
-是有很多什么东西  -我好像读到
- Full of something. - Didn't I read somewhere

1429
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,670
他们差点给自己起名
that they nearly called themselves

1430
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,440
-毒蘑菇  -没错
- The Toadstools? - That's right.

1431
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,730
纪念尼克和克里斯托弗以前服的致幻蘑菇
In honor of the mushrooming trips Nick and Christopher used to go on.

1432
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:54,610
如果起初是尼克和克里斯托弗的乐队
If it was Nick and Christopher's band originally,

1433
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,110
那个哥哥是个什么地位
then where did the other brother fit in?

1434
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,400
肯是更好的吉他手
Ken was the better guitarist.

1435
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,910
似乎是自己挤进去  夺过了控制权
Seems to have muscled his way in and taken control.

1436
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:04,120
克里斯托弗成了备胎
Christopher's become a bit of a spare wheel.

1437
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,440
但这就是娱乐圈嘛
But that's show business.

1438
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,480
车坏了
Car trouble?

1439
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:26,910
不是
Not quite.

1440
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,340
不是十字架吗
Not a cross then?

1441
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,650
你怎么想到的
Where'd you get that idea?

1442
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,900
楚拉夫的一句话
Something Trewlove said.

1443
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,890
他可能是被用车移尸吧
He could have been moved by car, couldn't he?

1444
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,100
趴着放
Laid face down.

1445
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,180
那就可能是十字扳手留下的印记了
The wheel brace could have caused that mark, then.

1446
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,840
格莱特利牧师的主要死因
The primary cause of Reverend Golightly's death

1447
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,310
是大出血导致心脏衰竭
was hemorrhage leading to heart failure.

1448
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,880
自然死亡吗
Natural causes?

1449
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,970
我没那么说吧
I don't think I said that, did I?

1450
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,820
那是什么导致的
So what caused it?

1451
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,070
泻药
Laxative.

1452
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:11,290
格莱特利牧师的肾基本完了
The Reverend Golightly's kidneys were all but shot.

1453
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:15,240
泻药中的镁导致了低镁症
Magnesium in the laxative caused hypomagnesemia,

1454
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,900
呼吸急促  低血压  心律失常
respiratory distress, low blood pressure, arrhythmia...

1455
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,530
所以才会吐血  是吧
That would explain the blood, would it?

1456
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,250
所以才会呕吐
It would explain the vomiting.

1457
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:23,370
但是
However,

1458
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,820
他还患有
he was also suffering

1459
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,770
未被发现的主动脉瘤
from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.

1460
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,060
其他症状让他的身体系统不堪重负
The rest of it put such a strain on his system

1461
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,170
主动脉瘤就破裂了
that it ruptured.

1462
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:32,560
因此才会出血
Hence the blood.

1463
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,400
把内脏吐出来了
Puked his guts up, then.

1464
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:35,810
毫不夸张
Literally.

1465
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,740
你当年一定是个诗意的孩子  警长
What a lyrical child you must have been, Sergeant?

1466
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,020
但本不该致命的
It shouldn't have been fatal, though.

1467
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:42,550
一般不会
Not ordinarily, no.

1468
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,450
至少对身体健康的人并不致命
Certainly not to anyone in decent health.

1469
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:15,910
上帝饶恕我
God forgive me.

1470
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,030
你好  客房服务
Hello, chambermaid?

1471
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:23,850
有人吗
Hello?

1472
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:34,000
先生
Sir?

1473
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,730
格莱特利有进展吗
Progress on Golightly?

1474
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:00,850
佩蒂博太太虽然
Mrs. Pettybon may have sent

1475
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:03,200
给自己寄了威胁信
the threatening letter to herself,

1476
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,140
但我们仍偏向于认为是杂志主编
but our favorite for dosing the chocolates

1477
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,300
给巧克力下了毒  长官
is still this magazine editor, sir.

1478
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,850
是啊  总体上有好多恨意
Yes, well, a lot of hate about altogether.

1479
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,510
比以前多了  是不是
More than there used to be, d'you think?

1480
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,670
我可说不好  长官
Oh, I wouldn't know, sir.

1481
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,460
是因为电视吗
Television, perhaps?

1482
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,970
佩蒂博太太是这么想的
That would certainly be Mrs. Pettybon's angle.

1483
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:21,950
两次世界大战
Two world wars.

1484
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,210
死了数百万人
Millions dead.

1485
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,040
那些暴行
Atrocities?

1486
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,470
集中营  原子弹
The camps? The Bomb?

1487
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,580
她要怎么把那归咎于电视
She'd be hard put to lay that at the door of television.

1488
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,710
恨一直存在  长官
Always been hate, sir.

1489
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,140
能追溯到该隐和亚伯
Right back to Cain and Abel.

1490
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,220
这也好吧
Just as well, I suppose.

1491
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,660
死了大概六小时了
Dead about six hours.

1492
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,150
那么是凌晨3点
So 3:00 in the night?

1493
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,710
差不多
Around then.

1494
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:01,780
死因呢
Cause?

1495
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,080
我得先检查一下才能知道
I shan't know until I've had a grub about.

1496
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,040
但他显然是吃坏了什么
But something disagreed with him, plainly.

1497
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,490
呕吐物里有尚未消化的巧克力
Half-digested chocolates amongst the ejecta.

1498
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,010
那是哪来的
Where've they come from?

1499
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,820
她昨晚收到了好多盒
She received boxes of them last night.

1500
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,270
佩蒂博太太
Mrs. Pettybon.

1501
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,070
在《年鉴》节目之后
After the Almanac show.

1502
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,570
巧克力  鲜花  祝福者送的
Chocolates, flowers, from well-wishers.

1503
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,130
据说她到哪都会如此
Happens wherever she goes, apparently.

1504
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,460
会不会是有人下药了
Could someone have laced them with something, do you think?

1505
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,140
有可能
Yes, perhaps...

1506
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,890
-医生  -先生们
- Doctor. - Gentlemen.

1507
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,950
没比往常严重
No more than usual.

1508
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,100
格莱特利牧师的事有消息了吗
Any news about Reverend Golightly?

1509
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:41,720
我恐怕已被撤出了案子
I've been taken off the case, I'm afraid.

1510
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:42,980
因为我
Because of me.

1511
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:43,640
不是
No.

1512
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,450
是因为我
Because of me.

1513
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,500
这是你吗
Is this you?

1514
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,890
小时候
It was. Once.

1515
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:56,870
你妈妈
Your mother.

1516
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,260
如果检测出来  那就三个了
If it does come back positive, that makes it three.

1517
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,430
巴里·芬奇  格莱特利牧师  尼克·威尔丁
Barry Finch, Reverend Golightly and now Nick Wilding.

1518
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,620
都算是被下毒了  至少是涉及到毒品
All poisoned, one way or another, drugs leastways.

1519
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,360
但尼克·威尔丁没死
Except Nick Wilding's not dead.

1520
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,530
那可能多是因为走运  而非判断力
More by luck than judgment maybe.

1521
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:16,330
或许吧  或许那只是为了封他的口
Maybe, or perhaps it was just an attempt to shut him up.

1522
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,470
为了什么事
About what?

1523
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,390
巴里·芬奇
Barry Finch.

1524
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,050
你本该保护我们
You were meant to keep us safe.

1525
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,160
威胁是针对你的
The threat was made against you.

1526
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,460
据我所知  你还在呢
So far as I can see, you're still here.

1527
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,280
我真不知道你为什么要来
I really don't know why you've come by.

1528
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,570
我说了我不打算起诉了
I said I didn't want to press charges.

1529
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,250
我们不是来谈你挨打的事  杰赛普先生
We're not here to talk about your beating, Mr. Jessop.

1530
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,700
我们是为佩蒂博太太而来
We're here to talk about Mrs. Pettybon.

1531
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,310
她害你的杂志社被关
She got your magazine closed down.

1532
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,230
《精彩时代》  是吧
Exciting Times, isn't that right?

1533
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,340
她还害我留了犯罪案底
She also landed me with a criminal record

1534
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,780
蹲了监狱
and a prison sentence.

1535
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,890
还顺带害我破产
Oh, and brought me to bankruptcy into the bargain.

1536
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,240
你应该不怎么喜欢佩蒂博太太咯
I imagine you don't much care for Mrs. Pettybon?

1537
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,080
我现在靠施舍
I'm living on handouts

1538
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,130
和一小笔我父母给的零用钱度日
and a small allowance from my parents.

1539
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,570
他们给我钱  是因为我答应
They give me money on the understanding

1540
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,050
再不会给他们蒙羞
I never darken their door again.

1541
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,730
我找不到工作
I can't get a job, I'm...

1542
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,460
芬奇参与了群交吗
So Finch was part of some sort of orgy?

1543
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,690
有些人喜欢
All right for some.

1544
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,470
可我连音乐抢椅子都抢不上
I could never get a seat at musical chairs,

1545
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,720
更别说别的了
never mind anything else.

1546
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,060
你不会喜欢的  警长  就你那后背
You wouldn't like it, Sergeant, not with your back.

1547
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,020
是巴里·芬奇的表
It's Barry Finch's watch.

1548
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,550
看来她是雨露均沾啊  这个皮帕
She was spreading her favors then, this Pippa girl?

1549
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,920
你在哪找到的
Where did you find it?

1550
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,360
一个空土耳其软糖盒里
In an empty Turkish Delight box

1551
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,790
放在尼克·威尔丁的小窝里
Nick Wilding kept in his den.

1552
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,960
或许他是留着自己欣赏
Maybe he kept it for his own entertainment.

1553
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,740
会不会是勒索
It could be blackmail, couldn't it?

1554
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,040
这如果登上周日报纸
It wouldn't do much for their image

1555
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,980
他们的形象肯定要受损
if this got into the Sunday papers.

1556
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,390
如今的流行明星不都这样吗  长官
Almost expected of pop stars these days, sir?

1557
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,890
也没几个会这样吧  长官
I don't know so much, sir.

1558
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,840
行了  警员
All right, Constable.

1559
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,630
不  说吧
No, no, go on,

1560
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,870
楚拉夫警员
Constable Trewlove.

1561
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:07,640
长官  公众意见很善变
Well, sir, the public can be pretty fickle.

1562
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,620
这样的丑闻可能让他们彻底完蛋
Something like this could bring the whole house of cards down.

1563
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,890
不
No.

1564
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,900
至少斯潘德为他们投资了那么多
Well, Spender has too much investment in those lads

1565
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,120
不会允许那种事发生
to let that happen.

1566
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:18,300
更重要的是  是谁拍的照片  为什么
The bigger point is, who took the picture and why?

1567
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:19,540
继续查
Keep at it.

1568
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,700
我有一两件事想问问佩蒂博太太
There's one or two things I want to put to Mrs. Pettybon.

1569
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,620
怎么回事
What's this?

1570
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,690
格莱特利案  长官  斯特兰奇
The Golightly case, sir. Strange?

1571
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,610
我查了查佩蒂博太太  长官
I've had a dig into Mrs. Pettybon, sir.

1572
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:29,100
她是没什么  但发现了她丈夫的案底
Nothing for her, but we've got a match on her husband.

1573
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,220
他不是死了吗
He's dead, isn't he?

1574
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:31,450
自杀
Suicide.

1575
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,410
女儿做完周日晚祷回来
Daughter got back from Sunday evensong

1576
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,550
发现他用腰带吊死在了栏杆上
to find him hanging by his belt from the bannister.

1577
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,350
原来他周五晚因严重猥亵罪被抓
Turns out he'd been pinched for gross indecency on the Friday evening

1578
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,130
周一本要上庭的
and was looking at court on the Monday.

1579
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:46,520
你现在一定
Well, I suppose you must be

1580
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,160
非常得意吧
feeling very pleased with yourself.

1581
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,350
并不
Not particularly.

1582
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,760
但这解释了你为何如此仇恨
But it certainly explains your vicious hatred

1583
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,620
达德利·杰赛普这种人
of men like Dudley Jessop.

1584
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,270
我爱我丈夫
I loved my husband.

1585
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,690
我以为他是的那个人
The man I thought he was.

1586
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:02,370
失去他  让我无比震惊
To lose him, it was a terrible shock.

1587
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,370
但得知他有那样的癖好...
But to find out that he'd been carrying on like that...

1588
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,140
是你逼他选了那条路
You drove him to it.

1589
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,230
我听到你说的话了
I heard you.

1590
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:14,050
他活该
It was what he deserved.

1591
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,440
那总比让全家蒙羞好
Better that than bringing shame on the family.

1592
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,460
你个贱人
You bitch'.

1593
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,540
你真是个贱人
You utter bitch'.

1594
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,250
好了
All right, all right.

1595
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,430
好了
All right.

1596
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:27,950
我要走了
I'm leaving.

1597
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:32,920
你下地狱去吧
You can rot in hell for all I care.

1598
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,440
她会回来的
She'll be back.

1599
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:41,770
不
No.

1600
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,310
她不会的
She won't.

1601
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,380
你觉得是怎么回事
What do you think happened?

1602
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,100
我觉得巴里·芬奇死在了枫芯堂
I think Barry Finch died at Maplewick Hall

1603
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,080
拉弗·斯潘德回来  收拾了残局
and Ralph Spender came back and tidied up,

1604
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,360
他们把芬奇的尸体搬去了酒馆院子
then moved Finch's body to the pub yard.

1605
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,290
那你怎么还不逮捕他
So why haven't you arrested him?

1606
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,890
因为到目前  他有不在场证明
Because so far his alibi stands up.

1607
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:11,090
他在伦敦跟美国那边通话
That he was in London on the phone to the United States,

1608
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:12,670
策划跟谁巡演...
planning a tour with the, uh...

1609
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,030
奇想乐团吗
Kinks?

1610
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,040
奇想乐团吗  不可能
The Kinks? He can't have.

1611
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,250
为什么
Why not?

1612
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,020
奇想乐团被美国禁了
The Kinks are banned from America.

1613
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,340
工作许可的什么问题
It's something to do with work permits.

1614
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,320
真的吗
Really?

1615
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:37,980
如果有人找我  我在枫芯堂
I'll be out at Maplewick Hall if anyone wants me.

1616
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:07,870

他不在
Um... he's not here.

1620
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,620
男生们带尼克去看专家了
The boys have taken Nick to see a specialist.

1621
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,860
在萨里郡什么地方
Somewhere in Surrey.

1622
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,760
拉弗少校和布鲁诺带他们去了
Major Ralph and Bruno have taken them.

1623
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,430
皮帕也去了

1624
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,280
你想喝一杯吗
Do you want a drink?

Yes, please.

1626

他们好像送她和孩子去克里斯妈妈家了

1629
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,770
在城里

1630
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,930
你被看到了  杰赛普先生
You were seen, Mr. Jessop.

1631
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:55,450
在《年鉴》节目后台转悠
Mooching around backstage at the Almanac show.

1632
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,010
你有充足机会
You had the perfect opportunity

1633
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,820
留下毒巧克力
to leave those poisoned chocolates.

1634
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,240
谁说的
Who told you that?

1635
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,060
那姑娘吗
The girl, I presume?

1636
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,290
什么姑娘
What girl?

1637
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:08,610
安娜-布丽特和尼克的关系如何
How were things between Anna-Britt and Nick?

1638
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,390
什么意思
How do you mean?

1639
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,960
尼克和克里斯是好朋友  是吧
Well, Nick and Chris were good friends, weren't they?

1640
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,630
他们是同学
They went to school together.

1641
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,500
我就想知道是否存在任何嫉妒...
I just wondered if there was any jealousy or...

1642
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,370
我说不好
I couldn't say.

1643
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,370
为什么这么问
Why?

1644
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,720
就是好奇
Just curious.

1645
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,050
她化妆间里有个年轻女人
There was a young woman in her dressing room.

1646
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,490
她说她是佩蒂博太太的助理
She said she was Mrs. Pettybon's assistant.

1647
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,830
她还问我为什么进去
She asked me what I was doing there.

1648
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,580
我说我迷路了  然后就走了
I said I was lost, and went on my way.

1649
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,860
她女儿吗  贝蒂娜
The daughter, you mean. Bettina?

1650
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,120
不是
No. No.

1651
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,560
我知道她的样子
I know what she looks like.

1652
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,470
小可怜
Poor creature.

1653
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:51,360
这个女孩  你能描述她吗
This girl, can you describe her?

1654
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,800
我可以去尼克房间看看吗
Would you mind if I looked in Nick's room?

1655
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,800
当然
Sure.

1656
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,900
毒巧克力是给佩蒂博太太的
The poisoned chocolates were meant for Mrs. Pettybon, all right.

1657
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,020
她威胁要禁止乐团的唱片在直播电视上播出
She threatened to have the group's record banned live on television.

1658
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,890
会是拉弗·斯潘德指使她的吗
Could Ralph Spender have put her up to it?

1659
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,690
那种事不利于乐团的销售量吧
Something like that could have damaged the group's sales, couldn't it?

1660
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:08,160
我觉得他也不会做得那么过分
I don't think even he'd go that far.

1661
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,630
他只会试图收买她
He'd have tried to buy her off.

1662
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,370
不  这就是仇恨
No, this is good old-fashioned hate.

1663
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,650
纯粹简单
Pure and simple.

1664
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,150
摩斯呢
Where's Morse?

1665
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,940
你在找什么
What is it you're looking for?

1666
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:26,730
我能帮忙吗
Can I help?

1667
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,100
皮帕在跟尼克上床
Pippa was sleeping with Nick.

1668
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,230
是吗
Is that right?

是
Yes.

1670
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,060
分分合合吧
On and off.

1671
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,230
还有巴里·芬奇
And Barry Finch.

1672
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:39,700
他怎么了
What about him?

1673
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,020
她也跟他上床了吗
Was she sleeping with him too?

1674
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:50,290
我得去接一下
I'd better get that.

1675
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:26,360

1676
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,090
我是瑟斯戴督察

01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,230
牛津市警局
Oxford City Police.

1678
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,500
你是谁
Who am I speaking to?

1679
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,520
喂
Hello?

1680
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,970
有位摩斯警员应该在你那里
I believe you have Detective Constable Morse with you.

1681
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,900
我想马上跟他说话
I'd like to speak to him now, please.

1682
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:38,570
喂
Hello?

1683
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,100
喂
Hello?

1684
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,710
你喜欢摄影
You're a keen photographer?

1685

It's my thing.

1686
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,310
拉弗说我们可能出本书
Ralph says we might do a book,

1687
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,900
乐队的照片集
pictures of the band.

1688
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,140
这是你拍的吗
So did you take this?

01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,730
是尼克  皮帕和巴里·芬奇  是吧
That's Nick, Pippa and Barry Finch, isn't it?

他们知道你拍了吗
Did they know you'd taken it?

1691
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,250
我猜他们不知道  他们睡着了
No, I don't suppose they did, they're asleep.

1692
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,260
-是尼克叫我拍的  -我觉得不是

01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,310
我觉得这是隐私
I think this was private.

1695
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,200
除了涉事人  应该没人知道
I doubt anyone knew, except those involved,

1696
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,450
当然了  你也知道
and you, of course.

1697
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,070
但你没受邀
Only you weren't invited.

1698
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,630
知道什么
Anyone knew what?

1699
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,850
尼克跟皮帕和巴里都上床了
That Nick was sleeping with Pippa and Barry.

1700
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,410
他们新专辑的标题就是
It's there in the title of their new album.

1701
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,640
《男孩女孩出来玩》
"Boys and Girls Come Out to Play."

1702
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,570
男孩和女孩
Boys and girls.

1703
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,410
他们唱片的沟槽上还有句话
There's also a message on the groove of the LP.

1704
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:33,560
YEMKTTHL4099
Y.E.M.K.T.T.H.L. 4099.

1705
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,820
那只是母带号
That's just a matrix number.

1706
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,030
"但每个人都杀死自己所爱"[王尔德]
"Yet each man kills the thing he loves."

1707
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:38,290
4099.

1708
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:40,160
是奥斯卡·王尔德在瑞丁监狱时的
The prisoner number assigned to Oscar Wilde

1709
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:40,160
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}因同性恋相关罪名入狱

1710
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,710
牢房号
when he was sent to Reading Jail.

1711
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,900
我觉得你无法忍受
I think you couldn't stand

1712
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,620
尼克跟巴里·芬奇上床了
that Nick was sleeping with Barry Finch,

1713
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,010
所以你等到他昏睡过去
so you waited until he passed out,

1714
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,350
便勒死了他
and then you strangled him.

1715
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,130
尼克醒来时
Nick must have come to,

1716
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:58,680
还没从毒品和酒精的作用下清醒过来
his mind still clouded by drink and drugs,

1717
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,570
看到巴里死在了他身边
found Barry dead beside him.

1718
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,470
他无法确定不是他的性爱游戏出了错
He couldn't be sure that his sex game hadn't gone wrong.

1719
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,100
-什么性爱游戏  -在萨德的《贾丝汀》里
- What "Sex game"? - In Justine de Sade's book--

1720
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,030
有一个角色
one of the characters

1721
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:11,220
让另一个人吊着他  直至他不省人事
has another hang him to the point of unconsciousness.

1722
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,730
我觉得尼克也尝试过这个点子
I think Nick experimented with the same idea.

1723
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,240
问题是
The thing is,

1724
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,460
你那晚其实只需要等
all you had to do that night, really, was wait.

1725
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,100
什么
What?

1726
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,990
你去勒巴里·芬奇的时候
By the time you strangled Barry Finch,

1727
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,410
他已经要死了
he was already dying.

1728
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:36,450
他对他服的毒品产生了不良反应
He'd had a bad reaction to the drugs he'd taken.

1729
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,820
但那还不够  是吧
But that wasn't it, was it?

1730
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,680
你本以为  除掉了巴里
You thought with Barry out of the way,

1731
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,180
尼克有天就会爱上你  但那是不可能的
Nick might one day be yours, but he never would have been.

1732
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,790
所以你才给他下了迷幻药
That's why you slipped him the LSD.

1733
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,340
我为什么要伤害尼克
Why would I hurt Nick?

1734
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,770
我爱他
I love him'.

1735
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,780
他也爱我
He loves me.

1736
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,370
我知道他爱我
I know he does.

1737
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,270
老天爷  他为我写了《詹妮弗有时》
For God's sake, he wrote "Jennifer Sometimes" for me'.

1738
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:54,300
不是的  那不是讲你的
No, he didn't. That's not about you.

1739
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,780
-就是  他说了  -不是的
- It is'. He told me. - No, it's not.

1740
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,340
"回到旧学校
"Go back to the old school.

1741
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,270
看一颗毒蘑菇下面"
Look under the toadstool."

1742
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,950
歌词跟你对不上
The lyrics don't apply to you.

1743
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,590
但跟克里斯托弗·克拉克对得上
But they do apply to Christopher Clark.

1744
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,750
是《克里斯托弗有时》
It's "Christopher Sometimes."

1745
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:11,030
但他总不能在电台上唱这个
But he could hardly put that on the radio.

1746
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,900
但...
But...

1747
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,660
那是我的名字
...it's my name.

1748
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,030
如果不是写给我的
If it wasn't for me,

1749
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,200
他又为什么要写詹妮弗
why would he call it Jennifer?

1750
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,790
为了韵律
To make scansion.

1751
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:25,550
克里斯托弗
Christopher,

1752
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:26,720
詹妮弗
Jennifer,

1753
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,240
音节一样多
same amount of syllable...

1754
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,910
出什么问题了吗
Something wrong?

1755
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,240
出什么问题了吗
Something wrong?

1756
01:23:58,670 --> 01:23:59,860
没事的
It's all right.

1757
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,970
没事的
It's all right.

1758
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,630
你不用怕什么
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1759
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,590
除非你有恐惧
Unless you have.

1760
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,710
你脑子里有什么  就会看到什么
What you take in with you is what you find in there.

1761
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:13,460
你一定看到过很恐怖的景象
You must have seen some terrible things.

1762
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,500
那都在等待你
It's all waiting for you.

1763
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,590
你能看到什么  摩斯
What's in there, Morse?

1764
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,130
-放开我  -摩斯
- Get off me'. - Morse'.

1765
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,380
摩斯
Morse'.

1766
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,010
摩斯
Morse'.

1767
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:33,590
好了
All right. All right.

1768
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,430
-放开我  -你给他下什么了
- Get off me. - What've you given him?

1769
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,700
你给他下什么了
What've you given him?'

1770
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,820
没事了  摩斯
All right, Morse.

1771
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,410
没事
All right.

1772
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,880
他能恢复吗
Will he recover?

1773
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:00,460
得等等看了  长官
Time will tell, sir.

1774
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,690
但他经历了地狱
But he's been to hell and back.

1775
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:09,040
只能希望她给他下的不是迷幻药
The only hope is it wasn't LSD she gave him.

1776
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,600
她把仅剩的都用在尼克·威尔丁身上了
She used the last of that on Nick Wilding.

1777
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,670
他的情况可不妙
And there doesn't look to be much hope for him.

1778
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,660
她给摩斯用了什么
So what did she use on Morse?

1779
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:22,190
混合物  天仙子  曼德拉草
A concoction of henbane, mandrake

1780
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,660
蔓陀罗
and jimsonweed...

1781
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,040
效果类似迷幻药
Effects are not dissimilar to LSD.

1782
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,540
也是她给佩蒂博太太寄了巧克力吗
And it was she who sent the chocolates to Mrs. Pettybon?

1783
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:32,730
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1784
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,190
她想报复她
She wanted to get back at her for

1785
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,080
企图让乐团的专辑被禁
trying to get the group's record banned.

1786
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,320
结果被格莱特利牧师吃了
Only they ended up with Reverend Golightly.

1787
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,400
这姑娘太可怕了
Girl sounds an absolute hellion.

1788
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,250
摩斯
Morse.

1789
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,070
摩斯
Morse.

1790
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,580
今天周几
What day is it?

1791
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:43,170
咸牛肉
Corned beef.

1792
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,370
是周五
It's Friday.

1793
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:55,750
是周五
It's Friday.

1794
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,900
没错
That's right.

1795
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:01,990
周五
Friday.

1796
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,340
她招了吗
Did she confess?

1797
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,420
艾玛
Um... Emma.

1798
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,550
嗯
Oh, yeah.

1799
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:18,170
是她把照片放在了土耳其软糖盒里
She planted the photos in the Turkish Delight box

1800
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,090
她给尼克下药  是想毁掉他的名声
after she'd doped Nick to discredit him.

1801
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,040
好吧
Well.

1802
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,790
我不打扰你休息了
I'd better let you get some rest.

1803
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,380
不急着回来
No need to rush back.

1804
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,270
你慢慢来
In your own good time.

1805
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,740
摩斯
Morse.

1806
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:47,230
牛津2947
Oxford 2947.

1807
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,500
我是接线员
This is the operator.

1808
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,320
这里有一通利明顿的对方付费电话
I have a reverse charge call from Leamington.

1809
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,350
你是否接受费用
Will you accept the charges?

1810
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,040
我在利明顿好像不认识谁
I don't think I know anyone in Leamington.

1811
01:30:58,770 --> 01:30:59,920
对对
Oh, yes.

1812
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:01,760
接受
Yes.

瑟斯戴小姐
Miss Thursday?

1817
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:32,500
对不起  先生  她挂断了
I'm sorry, sir, she's disconnected.
